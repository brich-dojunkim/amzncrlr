customer_review-R1XLLQMFTE6L1F,B0BBQZVQS3,"If you have sensitive skin, you need this!",5.0,"March 20, 2025",Amber K.,1,"Last week, I somehow messed my skin up. I didn‚Äôt use any new products on my skin, but I did re-introduce two products to my routine. I‚Äôm not sure if it was too much change too quickly or if one of those products didn‚Äôt mesh well with the rest of my routine. Whatever it was, my skin barrier was trashed. Like very painful burning, skin flaking off, super red. Miserable. After two days of dealing with that, I remembered seeing this product and decided to give it a try. I put this on clean skin, then topped with snail mucin essence, then moisturizer the night it arrived. I did the same routine in the next morning. By 24 hrs after the first application, my skin was 80% better. I could not be happier. I was seriously in so much pain. As someone with very sensitive skin, I will be keeping this on hand at all times. Worth every penny.",2,2025-04-15 12:25:04
customer_review-R125LL94D0GJVV,B0BBQZVQS3,Serum,4.0,"April 3, 2025",Li na,1,"I‚Äôve been using Jeoson Serum for about three weeks now, and I can honestly say I‚Äôm amazed by the results!

Pros:

Visible Results: After just a few days of use, I noticed my skin looked brighter and more even. By the end of week two, the fine lines around my eyes had visibly softened, and my complexion was much smoother.

Lightweight and Absorbent: The serum has a light, silky texture that absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling greasy or sticky. I can easily layer it under my moisturizer and sunscreen in the morning.

Gentle on the Skin: I have sensitive skin, and this serum didn‚Äôt cause any irritation or redness, which is a big plus for me. It feels calming and refreshing each time I apply it.

Great Ingredients: I love that Jeoson Serum contains a blend of vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and peptides, which are known to promote collagen production and hydrate the skin. It‚Äôs clear that a lot of thought went into the formulation.",0,2025-04-15 12:25:04
customer_review-R152RE2WU69JU6,B0BBQZVQS3,Soothed and smoothed,5.0,"January 30, 2025",A,1,"I have had some redness and tiny bumps on my cheeks for as long as I can remember, even back to childhood and before puberty. This calming serum reduced the redness and smoothed my skin down in DAYS and my cheeks are literally softer than they were when I was a child. The condition of my skin was never a big deal to start with, but the difference to me is huge and I feel so happy when I feel how soft my face is now.

The serum feels light and absorbs quickly, and a little goes a long way. The tip of the dropper is also shaped in a way that holds the serum better than some others I've had, so it's very hard for it to drip by accident and go to waste. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to get the serum at the bottom using the dropper once the bottle is almost empty, but I turned it over and let drip into a new bottle.",9,2025-04-15 12:25:04

customer_review-R20LLKQ0Z4F97P,B0BBQZVQS3,WORKS FOR MY HIGHLY SENSITIVE SKIN!!!,5.0,"August 24, 2023",Rebecca M.,1,"Let me start by saying I never leave reviews!!! I have always had sensitive skin. I have battled eczema and rashes that no doctor could diagnose. About 6 years ago I constantly had the rash in the last photo on and off. It burned and itched and felt like I had hundreds of blisters on my face. My dermatologist prescribed me steroids and steroid creams (not great because it thins your skin out over time). I‚Äôve done extensive allergy tests with no answer to what causes this.

I just turned 32 and desperately want to be a skincare girly. But the only things I could use on my face were okay sensitive face wash and Aveeno baby lavender lotion! Anything else has caused me to have a reaction. Even makeup wipes would send my skin into a frenzy and I‚Äôd end up at the doctors office.

I‚Äôve been doing research and wanted to use things that fellow sensitive skin people have tried with success. Along with reading extensive reviews. I decided to try this product and I am happy to say that I will be purchasing again! There is no stinging, burning or itching of any kind! I mean JUST LOOK AT MY GLOWING SKIN!",914,2025-04-15 12:25:08
customer_review-R924FGVZIGAQV,B0BBQZVQS3,BOJ gives a real glow not a greasy 'faux glow',5.0,"November 2, 2024",Kathryn Magendie,1,"I ordered this calming green tea serum after using up the small trial size I had from their set.

This is a very lightweight serum. I would almost call it an essence. I use this as one of my first steps after cleansing and toning.

I have Type 1 Rosacea, and this doesn't irritate my skin, and it does feel calming to my skin. Does it take away redness?--it may somewhat, but it does help to calm it before I go on to the rest of my skincare.

This along with their glow serums give my face that nice healthy glow. Not the greasy or oily 'faux glow' that some serums give, but a real healthy glow.

I also like their ginseng cleansing oil and their ginseng essence water.

BOJ is so gentle - no fragrances - cruelty-fee; just a lovely brand!",27,2025-04-15 12:25:08

It absorbs quickly, does not leave any sticky or tackiness behind, and is the only one I have been able to find that actually reduces redness. True to its name, this serum really does ‚Äúcalm‚Äù the skin. It might be a bit pricey, but the quality is so worth it!! Forever a staple in my day and night time routines.

UPDATE:
When I ran out of this serum, I tried a couple of others including Skin1004 and PURITO, which I must report neither got the job done for me the way this Beauty of Joseon Calming serum did. I have combination skin that varies from resilient to sensitive depending on the seasons, but no matter what, is always red. I use half a dropper full of this BoJ Calming serum and I‚Äôm good all day. They may as well rename it ‚Äúredness be gone‚Äù!
