customer_review-RSUM9C8YGANBZ,B08RLZ28QK,Hydration and Vitality with the Power of Ginseng,5.0,"March 14, 2025",Miguel,1,"The Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water is a fantastic choice for those looking for hydrated, balanced, and revitalized skin. Its formula features key ingredients such as 80% ginseng water, providing deep hydration, 2% niacinamide, which helps strengthen the skin barrier and minimize pores, and 0.5% BHA, perfect for gentle exfoliation without irritation.

This product works as a toner, essence, and lightweight moisturizer, making it versatile and suitable for both oily and dry skin. With regular use, the skin appears more radiant and healthy.

One thing to note is that while it provides good hydration, those with extremely dry skin might need an additional moisturizer. Overall, it’s a great K-Beauty essential worth trying!
El Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water es una excelente opción para quienes buscan una piel hidratada, equilibrada y revitalizada. Su fórmula combina ingredientes clave como el 80% de agua de ginseng, que proporciona una hidratación profunda, 2% de niacinamida, que ayuda a mejorar la barrera cutánea y reducir los poros, y 0.5% de BHA, ideal para exfoliar suavemente sin irritar la piel.

Es un producto versátil que funciona tanto como tónico, esencia e hidratante ligero, adaptándose bien a diferentes tipos de piel, ya sea grasa o seca. Tras varias aplicaciones, se nota una piel más luminosa y saludable.

El único punto a considerar es que, aunque hidrata bien, quienes tienen piel extremadamente seca podrían necesitar un refuerzo con una crema más densa. En general, es un excelente producto de K-Beauty que vale la pena probar.",6,2025-04-15 12:27:57
customer_review-RJQ7JWYSLBZPM,B08RLZ28QK,It was great till it was not..,5.0,"September 3, 2024",Monica,1,"I really do not do reviews but in this case I feel like I have to, to warn people have sensitive skin to be careful if they want to try this skincare line. I ordered my first beauty of Joseon last year I got the ginseng toner, the cleanser and the serum that goes with it. Up on using the product I felt that my skin is healthy and glowing and clear then it have ever been. And to make it clear I have a hyper sensitive skin and on top of that I have eczema so my skin can flare up anytime if it wants to or if I use something that irritates it. Since I use the products for a year everything was doing fine everything was perfect I'm loving the product there's no problem with it my skin is loving it not until the beginning of this year all of a sudden my face broke out. My face started to itch I thought it was just itchy but when I look at it on the mirror I see some redness on my skin and some rash, so basically my face was flaring up but I did not blame it to the skincare that I was using because like I said a year prior everything was perfect so I thought it's just my skin doing its thing and it's going to go away. So I stopped using the skin care line until my face was fully healed so that was about June when my face finally healed from the flare-up that I had from the beginning of the this year. I didn't use the toner because I ran out, but I still have the oil based cleanser and I'm being using it on and off and my face is okay it didn't flare up it no allergic reaction or anything like that. decided to reorder the toner Plus the light vitamin C serum and got delivered yesterday, so I opened up the new bottle of toner and the vitamin C light serum and use it exactly at 9:40 p.m.. but when 3:00 a.m. came left corner of my lips was kind of itchy so I checked it out on the mirror and it was red and I was praying in my heart that it wasn't from the toner and the term that I used prior before going to work. But as the morning progress the T-Zone area on my face flared up now it have a full-blown allergic reaction it have this small type of rash and it's red and it's itchy. So I am sad to say I am discontinuing using the toner and serum. before knowing that the cause of my previous allergic reaction was this skin care line I reordered the snail serum as well because I was using that last year and I really like the results. Now I'm sad because not only did I feel like I wasted my money now I don't know what to do with this brand new products especially the snail serum that is going to be delivered tomorrow.
So in conclusion for all of the people who have sensitive skin and their skin can be easily irritated please be careful before buying this or any type of skin care. Just make myself clear I'm not saying the product is not good because like I said I love the product and it worked on me last year when i got it.",74,2025-04-15 12:27:57

Works best if applies on a very damp/slightly wet face and once your skin dries down you will notice the difference in how it feels.

customer_review-R2QYCJJX1YKYG0,B08RLZ28QK,Lovely essence that's not over-priced,5.0,"April 19, 2024",Kathryn Magendie,1,"Update: I reorder this whenever I am out - I love what it does to and for my skin. They also have a ginseng/snail mucin mix that works so well for my rosacea redness. If I use CosRX centella asiatica toner, then this ginseng essence, and top it off with either CoxRX snail mucin or the BOJ ginseng/smail mucin, my skin is not only glowing with a healthy glow, but the redness is very much calmed down! That's all I have on my face as I write this and my skin feels wonderful. I will add some retinoid and/or moisturizer later.

Love it!
--------------------

This is my first try of Beauty of Joseon and I would definitely try other products from this brand. My skin loves K-beauty, and as well I often find some K-beauty brands are not as pricey. This one is reasonably priced and a little goes a long way so that makes the value better as well.

I love how you have to 'shake out' a bit of the essence so that it isn't wasted - not to much comes out at a time and you don't need much. A few shakes onto my palm and I pat and then press the essence onto my skin. Patting and pressing works better than trying to 'rub' it onto the skin.

I do a multi-step routine - since I work remotely, I have the time to take my time. I cleanse and immediately use a toner--though this is both essence and toner, right now I have a separate milky toner. I sometimes apply this essence right after toning or I'll wait 10-15 minutes. I wait another 15 minutes or more and then comes my vitamin c. Waiting between each product allows it time to absorb into my skin (at least this is what my research indicates). It also gives my skin time to settle down between products. I apply my serums and moisturizers, and SPF last when I'm leaving the house.

Essences are mostly water and that's what they are supposed to be so don't expect something thicker or emollient. Essences are made to go on early in your routine, after cleansing, whether you use them as a toner or just an added step after toning as I'm doing right now until my milky toner runs out and then I will use this as one step toning and essence and see how that goes.

I have rosacea-prone skin and there is zero irritation or redness, no burning or itchy feeling. My skin tolerates this essence very well. It leaves my skin looking bright and refreshed.

There is 2% Niacinamide included, which is a form of vitamin B and though it's a small amount, it's still a powerhouse ingredient.

Ginseng is known for its anti-aging qualities, inflammation reducing, and brightening for the skin.

I'm happy with my order.",102,2025-04-15 12:27:57

customer_review-R20A7Z5IJD6R1P,B08RLZ28QK,This product was all over my instagram..,3.0,"September 27, 2023",Sarah,1,"The Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water is a popular Korean skincare product that combines traditional herbal ingredients with modern skincare science. Here's a review of this essence water based on its performance and qualities:

Pros:

1. Hydration: This essence water is exceptionally hydrating, making it an excellent choice for those with dry or dehydrated skin. It provides a surge of moisture that leaves the skin feeling plump and refreshed.

2. Key Ingredient: Ginseng: Ginseng is a renowned traditional Korean skincare ingredient known for its anti-aging and skin-firming properties. This product contains a high concentration of ginseng extract, which can help improve skin texture and elasticity over time.

3. Lightweight Texture: The essence water has a lightweight and watery consistency that absorbs quickly into the skin. It's suitable for layering with other skincare products in your routine.

4. Brightening Effect:t This product contributes to a brighter complexion and helps even out skin tone. The ginseng extract is believed to enhance skin radiance.

5. Gentle and Suitable for Sensitive Skin: This essence water is formulated without parabens, artificial fragrances, or other potentially irritating ingredients. It's suitable for sensitive skin types and is dermatologist-tested.

6. Packaging: The product is packaged in a beautiful glass bottle that adds a touch of luxury to your skincare routine. The pump dispenser is convenient and hygienic.

Cons:

1. Scent: I find the scent of this product to be slightly herbal or medicinal, which could be a personal preference issue. However, the scent dissipates quickly upon application.

2. Price: Beauty of Joseon products are considered to be on the higher end of the Korean skincare spectrum. While the quality justifies the cost for many, it may not fit everyone's budget.

3. Not Ideal for Oily Skin: Due to its rich hydration properties, this essence water may feel heavy on oily or acne-prone skin. It's better suited for individuals with dry to normal skin types.

In conclusion, the Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water is a highly effective and hydrating skincare product, particularly well-suited for those with dry or dehydrated skin. Its star ingredient, ginseng, provides anti-aging and brightening benefits over time. The lightweight texture and gentle formula make it a popular choice among skincare enthusiasts, although the price may be a consideration for some. If you're looking to incorporate the benefits of ginseng into your skincare routine and prioritize hydration and luminosity, this essence water is worth considering, especially if you appreciate the luxurious packaging and Korean skincare traditions.",166,2025-04-15 12:27:57

This is the real thing, and I'm very pleased with it so far. It does not break or damage my sensitive skin barrier. Huge win for me. I use it in perhaps an unconventional manner.

Wait about a minute and put on eye serum and then face serum, followed by my moisturizer. This is my night routine.

I first got it at a shop. always been fan of Beauty of Joseon but never used this. I've used up 2 bottles now and currently subscribed to receive this every 4 months. This last a long time.

My skin was uneven, pigmented and a little dry from too much sun. So based on the good reviews I thought I'd give this a try. After about two weeks of using this twice daily, I can't believe how bright and plump my skin looks and feels. You do have to get used to the earthy smell and the texture is sort of slippery and sits on your skin but once it dries it's weightless. I top it off with Jumiso All Day Vit brightening serum and started both at the same time so tbh I'm not sure if it's the toner, serum or combination. In any case it works. Note that it does not lighten your skin just evens out darkish areas so you can still see my freckles but for some reason my skin glows. :) It comes in a cool thick plastic bottle which makes you wonder why Asian packaging is so awesome yet affordable.",15,2025-04-15 12:28:05

My skin has become even and after using this toner it looks dewy and hydrated.

This last bottle I receive had a root scent to it which it didn't have a scent in the past. I was worried it had gone bad or that they changed the formulation. I verified it on the Beauty of Joseon website and it wasn't expired, so far it has work the same as usual.",22,2025-04-15 12:28:05

I noticed that it made my skin feel a little dry, which was unexpected since I’ve heard so many great things about it.

That said, I can see how it might work well for others, especially those with oilier skin types.

I ordered this toner not knowing what it would exactly do to my skin but it actually hydrates my skin a lot. I used to only put moisturizer thinking it was enough for my dry skin, but I would wake up with a dry skin skin. This toner regulates the moisture and keeps my skin hydrated 24/7. The texture is very light too so it does not feel heavy when you have a long skincare routine.

It feels nice in the skin but I broke out within days of using it . Not too much but more than I expected. I’ve rarely used ginseng products but I’m going to stick with it for a couple of months because the breakout only lasted for two days . Not sure if it’s my cycle or the product I’ll check back in a few months . It’s not moisturizing for me and I have oily skin. If I had an essence I would add a moisturizing essence on top . However I will say it absorbs quickly and controls sebum !!! My pores have seemed smaller I know you can’t shrink pores but these prevent my pores from expanding. It works for my neck and top part of my face wonderfully but not for my jawline where I get acne. It feels sticky at first but quickly goes away then my skin just feels refreshed. I wanted it for my whole face but maybe I’ll use another toner/essence for my jaw…. I’ll check back in a few months for updates,17,2025-04-15 12:28:11

Either way, my skin is clearing up and looking really good so I don’t intend to stop using this. The bottle is a good size and is sturdy. Very good quality.

**UPDATE** Been using this for months now and firstly, it’s not a toner! Haha whoops. But it’s actually working nicely still. I use pretty much only Beauty of Joseon now (cleanser, this essence, the hanbang serum, and gel moisturizer) and my skin is super clear! I had great pores before but I really do feel like I look healthier and that’s weird since my diet needs changing lol.

Since I’m unable to shell out an arm or a leg, I decided to give this product a try.

The whole point of essence is to prep your face for the moisture and goo to come, and let me tell you that just TWO drops of this stuff will give your face a sticky feeling that bodes well for gripping the heck out of whatever might come next (it’s serum).

There’s no smell and it doesn’t burn, however I haven’t tried drinking it or putting it in my eyes, as this is not part of any skincare routine as far as I know. My skin has had no negative reaction to it whatsoever.

While i did question the product itself at first, turns out I was using it incorrectly. I was not using this product as a toner, I had thought it was just an essence and trying to use cotton to get it on my skin was akward. Using this at the appropriate time in my routine and applying with my fingers (while admittedly a bit messy) has made a huge difference. I can see and feel a difference in my skin, I really feel this product has seriously done some work for skin in just a few weeks of consistency. It always leaves a pleasant feeling on my skin as well, which is a huge plus if you have sensitive skin like I do and you never quite know what to expect.

I think it is a refreshing step and so far I like it. I have read about the benefits of ginseng and how it is an invigorating ingredient. I will update later after prolonged use.

UPDATE: after a few weeks of using this essence I can see why some people recommend this brand. The essence is lightweight but when applied on the skin it leaves the skin feeling soft without any sticky residue. I added the essence to my daylight routine in combination with a Vit C serum, a moisturizer of this same brand and a sunblock. I have noticed that the slight redness I get on the top of my cheeks is almost imperceptible now.

The ginseng water doesn't really have a scent to it? It does smell a little like musty rain if anything. I'm not too big of a fan of the scent. Applying the water does make my acne a little inflamed for 30 minutes so on days where my acne is bad, I don't apply it.

I did a patch test and found it did legitimately nothing, but (unfortunately) I stuck with it because I thought it would get better the more I used it.

Instead, it formed closed comedones mainly around my temples, cheeks, and eye area. These eventually developed into deep, painful breakouts that would last weeks. I have acne-prone, oily skin so that might be why, but I've never experienced a reaction like this from a skincare product.

On top of that it never hydrated, soothed, or improved my skin barrier in any way. In fact it left an uncomfortable, tacky residue on my skin so it didn't even feel good to apply. Sad to say but be wary of this product if you have sensitive skin. 😔",0,2025-04-15 12:28:23
