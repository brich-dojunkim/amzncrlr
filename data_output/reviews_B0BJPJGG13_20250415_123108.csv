I have dehydrated skin: dry and oily (not combo). Been searching for 20 ANOS for a moisturizer that is gel form, water based, light and highly moisturizing WITHOUT making me oily hours later.

AND FRAGRANCE FREE. Because lets face it, any company adding fragrance to their moisturizer has IMMEDIATELY lost all credibility....its their way to say ""we dont gaf what your skin absorbs""

I lightly dampen my skin after my serums and rub this silky, velvety, loveliness into my skin

Im also using Rx Retinol which makes you flaky at first. No matter how much of this stuff i use to contain the flakiness, IT STILL NEVER MAKES ME OILY!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

And yall, speaking of retinol - stop buying it

Studies prove OTC strength retinol is NOT effective. Manufacturers know this. Its all a scam. So call your regular doc right now and have them phone in an Rx for either the cream or gel retinol.

I promise it works amazingly.",92,2025-04-15 12:30:42

customer_review-R1KVW1OG0N71A4,B0BJPJGG13,First gel based moisturizer.,4.0,"April 2, 2025",Wren,1,"Been using it for a couple of days with Anua color correcting serum after my nightly shower routine. Before this is was using a pot face cream that cost like 34$ so double what this costs. Works best on damp/wet skin, noticed that it makes skin more sticky if you apply it dry. if you use too much you will notice, like i had to wash off the excess when i used it for the first time bc it just wouldnt absorb and left a film on my face. So far i think i like it, i will see if i get another - i have been using a lot of BoJ products and most of them work really well.

Pros: Very little needed, absorbs very fast. Results are very nice - skin feels super soft once it absorbs fully.

Cons: Causes kind of a tacky/sticky sensation on the face while its absorbing. Takes a couple of moments to absorb.",0,2025-04-15 12:30:42

While I like my heavier lotions for the evening, I started using this during the day because my skin just looks smoother and less congested. It also gives a bit of a nice hydrated glow, I could see this being a good option if you want a dewy or glass skin look.

I have combo skin that is acne prone and dries out easily, and those of us with this skin type know the struggle of finding a moisturizer that works well without causing breakouts. This stuff gets all my dry areas without causing any reactions to my skin. It goes on easily, and does feel a bit tacky and sticky before it absorbs. Once it absorbs, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and plump. If you have really dry skin then it may not be enough on its own, but I find it works well when I layer it with a hydrating serum or toner. I also like that it comes in a squeeze tube instead of an unsanitary tub. The size makes it a great value for the money, and I find that it is better quality than a lot of Western made moisturizers.

I‚Äôm surprised at how much I like this. Im picky about my skin care.

customer_review-R27GKMH92P2TL7,B0BJPJGG13,Not for me sadly üò≠,2.0,"August 26, 2023",Chromebunny,1,"The packaging is so cute and the ingredients seem stellar, contains one pore clogging ingredient from what I‚Äôve found but figured it would be alright.

Sadly didn‚Äôt agree with me, my skin feels drier than normal and fine lines are appearing in random spots overnight. I have combination (oily t zone) acne prone skin and thought one pore clogging ingredient (corn based ingredient) wouldn‚Äôt hurt too much. Unfortunately am breaking out in closed comedones in very odd spots I don‚Äôt normally get CC and my skin feels so tight and wrinkled in weird spots all of a sudden.

I could look past the breakouts if it was hydrating enough over my hyaluronic acid serum (torriden dive in serum) but the two definitely aren‚Äôt mixing (I am applying on wet skin etc torriden serum has been working wonderfully for me until this) and this doesn‚Äôt seem hydrating enough to sustain a skincare routine that demands extra hydration to accommodate for actives. The sudden appearance of random wrinkles, cracks, and tightness seemingly overnight kinda tipped me off to something being pretty wrong. Tried this without my HA serum as well wondering if maybe I was just mixing some stuff wrong somehow and still felt incredibly tight and dried for days as well as seeing new weird acne spots and wrinkles more fitting for a 40 year old rather than a 28 year old.

I wanted so badly to love this bc the packaging is cute and low pore clogging ingredients/a few beneficial ingredients but even as I type this the leftover red bean gel on my hands is making them feel SO dry and cracked, the hunt for a HG moisturizer continues üò≠

My routine upon receiving this product:
AM
-light penny sized dollop face wash with skin food foaming rice cleanser (been using this for a couple years no issue brightens my complexion)
-cold water
-keep face fairly wet then apply torriden dive in serum (not touching toners rn as I‚Äôm slowly reintroducing things back into my routine)
-red bean gel a quarter sized dollop applied as my skin was still damp
PM
the same but double cleansing incorporating anua oil cleanser before everything (anua oil cleanser hasn‚Äôt ever broken me out before or dried me and has previously helped my closed comedones and blackheads)

Gave up cera ve face lotion bc it broke me out so badly for so long and tried this to hunt for something better but at least cera ve was hydrating. Hopefully this product works for somebody it‚Äôs so cute I‚Äôm jealous of y‚Äôall !

Two stars bc cute packaging, nice ingredients on first glance (make sure to google the ingredients and plug/copypaste them into a skincare ingredient checker just for your own knowledge and peace of mind as you explore your skincare journey and figure out what works for you and what doesn‚Äôt) and the texture is SO nice like cooling jelly. The tackiness upon drying makes foundation almost buttery to apply. Those were the only benefits for me.

I have the dynasty cream by BOJ as well, and that's great for when I'm flakey. But this red bean water gel is just perfect for summer. It's much lighter than a cream, it absorbs nicely, but it's not so light that it feels like nothing. I love it. The bottle is also gorgeous. And it's huge!!",10,2025-04-15 12:30:56

If you‚Äôre someone who does their makeup right after their skincare, I would wait a good long while after applying this to do your makeup when it isn‚Äôt sticky. I was using this at night but it took too long to dry down and I could feel my cheek sticking to my pillow slightly, so I switched to using it in the morning and I use a different moisturizer at night.
