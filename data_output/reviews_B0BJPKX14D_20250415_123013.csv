customer_review-R1LCTEVXGSJQ10,B0BJPKX14D,Love it!,5.0,"December 29, 2024",sana shaikh,1,"The Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Refreshing Pore Mask is an absolute gem for anyone looking to detoxify their skin while maintaining hydration. As someone with oily skin, I’m always on the lookout for products that purify without leaving my skin feeling stripped, and this mask delivers perfectly.

The formula is enriched with red bean extract, which is known for its antioxidant properties. The texture is smooth with a gentle, grainy consistency—enough to provide light exfoliation but not so rough that it irritates. Applying it feels like a mini spa experience; the mask spreads easily and has a natural, earthy scent that’s soothing without being overwhelming.

I left it on for about 10 minutes, during which it didn’t dry out uncomfortably like some clay masks do. Washing it off was easy, and I loved the slight scrubbing effect as I rinsed. The results were immediate—my skin felt clean, refreshed, and soft, with noticeably minimized pores around my T-zone.

What I appreciate most is that, unlike many pore-focused masks, it didn’t leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my face felt balanced, as if it had just hit the reset button.

This mask is perfect for weekly use, especially if you’re dealing with congestion or dullness. The Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Mask combines tradition with modern skincare needs beautifully, making it a must-try for anyone seeking gentle yet effective pore care.",47,2025-04-15 12:29:46
customer_review-R3L1XQEJBT78IW,B0BJPKX14D,One of my favorite products,5.0,"April 7, 2025",Steph,1,"I have dry sensitive skin and have tried many different products to even the texture and color of my face, and I have to say this is the only one I use regularly because I love the way it feels. It’s very refreshing, I like to use this one in the morning and then the rice mask at night by the same brand. They make my skin feel fresh and smooth, and they don’t cause irritation instead it calms some of the redness I usually experience. There’s a notable difference in my skin when I use this regularly and when I don’t use it for a few days in terms of lasting hydration and skin elasticity. The little tubs also go a long way, I would say it’s a great product at a great price.",0,2025-04-15 12:29:46

customer_review-RL586X1HTJCKY,B0BJPKX14D,"Good for oily skin, sensitive not so much",4.0,"July 19, 2024",Elliott Grant,1,"This was my first time trying this product and I wasn't sure how I felt about it at first, but in the end I decided it's not for me. It has a strong scent despite having no added fragrance. I had it on for about 15 minutes and while it was on it felt kind of tingly and weird but not unpleasant. It was a bit hard to wipe off, but once I did it left my skin feeling very clean and soft but also very dry. Then the prickly feeling started, which lasted for a while and was very unpleasant. I have sensitive skin but I'm not sure how to pinpoint which ingredient(s) would irritate my skin.

The container is a decent size and comes with a little plastic spatula, although I used my own silicone tool to apply it. Overall I would say it's probably a great product for people with super oily skin, but I think it's just not for me.",20,2025-04-15 12:29:46

I have had it for a little while and, when I purchased it, I was worried that it would be pricey for how many times I'd be able to use it before I'd run out, but I am happy to say that was an entirely unfounded worry lol. I've used it 25 times so far, and I'm not even halfway through. It feels so nice and fancy compared to slimy sheet masks, and it's got a super nice texture. Not to mention what it does for my skin! My skin is always so bright and healthy looking afterwards, and it feels super soft too. It's not sticky or drying at all, and I'd totally buy it again when I run out!

customer_review-RSLV7U2ZP1QPZ,B0BJPKX14D,"Okay, This is Pretty Amazing…",5.0,"December 7, 2024",Linné,1,"Okay, I have to admit - this red bean pore mask was pretty amazing! While I can’t say it did wonders on my blackheads and/or pores (since I haven’t used it long enough yet to comment on), what did work was on an angry pimple I had smack dab on the forehead. I have combo skin and endless blackheads but rarely do I get pimples. If I happen to get a blemish, it’ll get zapped with Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Spot Gel before it becomes anything larger. This particular pimple I had was an angry one which given a bit of time became pus-filled. Since I had this mask in my arsenal, I decided to give it a shot. It definitely brought the white pus to the surface which left me with no choice but to drain it - all this while instantly brightening up my face and leaving me with a gorgeous glow. This mask and that of Beauty of Joseon’s honey oatmeal version worked beautifully in conjunction on my skin and with solving this pimple. I used the latter a day later to calm down the inflammation and in no time, the dark spot left from the pimple was dissolved. Sure, there’s still a remnant left of a dark spot but I’ll continue busting the issue with these two masks and I have high hopes it’ll take care of the minor mark. This only took me two days to resolve - red bean pore mask on one day and the honey oatmeal mask on another. That’s quite the track record and I wasn’t expecting any promising results at all! Highly, highly recommend.",0,2025-04-15 12:29:49

customer_review-R2TD98R8KBOE8W,B0BJPKX14D,Know your skin type,5.0,"October 30, 2024",Jess,1,"So this is our extremely oily skin. This is not for combination. Skin does not work that well on it. If your skin is oily due to make up, this is not the product for you. I use this to minimize my pores.. it works, wonders it leaves my skin, soft and moisturized without the oily shine that I normally have. It lasts for an extremely long amount of time for the size of the container. I am happy with the product. I have been using their products for a while. I am 38 years old and I have always had extremely oily skin. I didn’t buy this because of TikTok. I bought this because I was looking for something that would help remove oil.
So I’ve read on some of the reviews people say that it smells bad. I think it smells like bean paste. It doesn’t really have a clay texture because I also have clay masks, and I can feel the difference at the texture. For me, it does not sting my face unlike when I do my clay mask with apple cider vinegar. I can feel that one tightening my face. This one is a soothing oil remover that I sometimes forget I have on my face. I can walk around my whole house with it on and wash it off after 10 minutes sometimes I leave it on longer cause like I said I forget that it’s there.
I would recommend this every single time. I have my I would never recommend this for someone who has dry skin or normal skin cause this would probably dry you out so much that it would cause you to get more acne.
So I will emphasize to definitely know your skin type.",21,2025-04-15 12:29:51

First of all I have an extremely oily skin with large pores. It's also prone to hormonal acne especially during my pms. I've been using this mask for 2 weeks and I can see the results already. My skin is much less oily and my pores look smaller for the first time ever.

I took a chance on this one - I was skeptical of the beads - but they were extremely soft and non-abrasive like the apricot scrubs, etc. The mask came with a spatula (smaller than imagined, but it’s the perfect size) most masks don’t come with one so that was bonus points already! It went on so smoothly & didn’t burn or irritate my skin. I left it on for 13 minutes & it seemed to work great, I might try 14 minutes next time. It washed off pretty easily, the beads were did come off into the sink but easily washed away. The best part…. It didn’t make my skin feel dry or tight once I washed it off! I got busy for about ten minutes after taking it off and my skin didn’t feel tight AT ALL.

Also, my biggest pores are in between my eyebrows but generally my t-zone. I’m not kidding when I say they were visibly smaller afterwards. Not completely “gone” obviously but significantly smaller. I felt so clean after. 10000000/10 I love this mask so far!",14,2025-04-15 12:29:57

I tend to get texture on just my chin and it’s Annoying at times lol. When using this product after letting my face get a bit steamy from the shower or a steamer I can definitely see a difference in texture. I love it , my skin doesn’t feel stripped it’s moisturizing! the smell is very soft , I love the red bean scent. The quality is amazing for the money.

The first time I used it, I used the tiny spatula that came with it, and it doesn’t spread very easily, which is why I gave it 4 stars. The second time, I just used my fingers, and it went on so much easier! It looks like it would be really thick and pasty when it’s in the container, but it spreads on very creamy and smoothly. It washes off easily, and I continue my skincare routine. My skin feels refreshed, exfoliated, and overall much smoother.

customer_review-R145BFVUW8S815,B0BJPKX14D,"Very nice, non irritating mask",5.0,"December 7, 2023",Benjamin Haworth,1,"So far after only one use, I really enjoy the mask. I can’t speak to its exfoliating properties because I haven’t been using it long enough, but I can speak to the immediate effects. My skin is super sensitive. If you poke my skin, it will turn red and splotchy. A lot of clay/exfoliating masks will burn as soon as it touches my skin. I read another review saying this mask made their skin burn, so I was just expecting the same to happen for me, but it didn’t! No burning or tingling at all, and the grains are very very soft and not scratchy at all. I was expecting it to be a lot like the Glow Recipe hyaluronic clay mask, which burned the crap out of my face, so much so that my eyes watered. It is nothing like that mask, and it’s very soothing if anything. The grains/granules are soft but also hard enough to get the feeling of a physical exfoliator. It also doesn’t dry down and get itchy or cracky like a typical clay mask. It also smells like bananas to me lol I love my first experience and I can’t wait to use it more often and see results from the exfoliation!",79,2025-04-15 12:30:06
customer_review-R2U35GX89VIZ46,B0BJPKX14D,Beauty of Joseon mask,5.0,"May 1, 2024",RD,1,This is my very first mask that I ever tried so far and I would have to say it’s a really good mask. Also it does get ride of the redness because I like to use this once a week but after I use a pimple needle tool to get ride of my black and white beads and it leave a red mark after I am done using the tool. After I do that and then put on this red mask and leave it on for 13 minutes I can already see the red marks from the needle is gone already and it really gets into the pores. Another thing is that I just repurchased it a few day ago because how good the face mask is and would definitely recommend this product.,4,2025-04-15 12:30:06

It gave a very refreshing feeling after I removed it from my face! The smell is just like any other clay mask.

customer_review-R2AFUVVHWOMI7E,B0BJPKX14D,very nice on the skin,5.0,"May 6, 2024",Kelsey Nicole,1,"texture: almost paste like with little micro bean pieces i’m assuming?
quality: worth the money. i noticed a difference literally after first use and had to keep note so i can repurchase when i run out!
washability: does not stain. i use a white clean skin disposable towel and the color never stays.
application: comes with a spatula!! ALWAYS wash your face befure using a mask for maximum benefit and so it can do its job. NEVER use your hands to remove the product from the container. this causes cross contamination and puts bacteria in your mask 🫤 remember this with all products! easy to apply and easy to wash off. has a natural smell not a fragrance one.
size: really good size container with reasonable amount of product for the price.",86,2025-04-15 12:30:09

When I first used this mask it took the entire top layer of sebum out of my blackheads, making them look gone until they oxidized again.

It smells like delicious candy (which is weird and made me hungry the whole time using it) and had a very off putting texture.
