customer_review-R1IKN0T49AMZJ8,B0B3R661JP,Luxurious and Effective,5.0,"April 7, 2025",Adrena Monic,1,"I‚Äôve been using this product for a month now and I LOVE it!
1. A little goes a long way, as with all Beauty of Joseon products. I love them all by the way.
2. Very nice and smooth going on my face. I look forward to using it almost everyday. I switch up with the Joseon Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser but I like this cleansing balm better. It feels like I‚Äôm rubbing luxury on my skin. Face and neck.
3. I do not wear makeup. This is not just for makeup removal! I use it to clean my face and I do not have to follow up with a face wash. This works fine on its own.
4. This is the only cleansing product that shrinks the strawberry pores on my nose! Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Refreshing Pore Mask also works but it‚Äôs not a cleanser and I do not use it everyday like this cleansing balm.
5. It goes on like an oily cream but rinses off like water. That doesn‚Äôt make sense does it? I‚Äôm trying to say it‚Äôs not a messy and it rinses right off easily!
6. My face feels so smooth and hydrated when I‚Äôm finished! Of course I still follow up with my moisturizers (mixsoon and castor oil), but it doesn‚Äôt leave my face ridiculously dry like some other products.
7. Scent free

I hope you have a great experience like mine.",0,2025-04-15 12:32:35

I washed my face with my daily cleanser after to see if there was any makeup that could be left, and the soap was white still with no makeup left behind.

customer_review-R3PDQ95Z9Y6YB1,B0B3R661JP,BOJ has never done me wrong but ...,4.0,"December 28, 2024",Travis,1,This is a great quality cleansing balm overall. I'm a guy so I wasn't looking to remove a lot of make-up or anything just a cleansing option that's super moisturizing for my dry skin especially as I'm getting older and seeing more lines. It leaves your skin feeling clean but soft and hydrated. My only complaint is that I started to get more breakouts and large pimples after a month or so of using it. I never break but it's kind of a given with a balmy product like this and my skin but it was great while it lasted. I guess I'm just meant to look old and dry if I don't want acne/breakouts.,2,2025-04-15 12:32:39

customer_review-R3SOHVURJW7ES8,B0B3R661JP,Fantastic find for dry and fragile skin,5.0,"November 30, 2024",Ecstatic Thrum,1,"About a year or two ago, my normally soft, supple and clear skin took a complete and total dive.

Unfortunately serving as a harbinger for the health problems underlying its condition.

And while I'm still knee deep in identifying all the moving parts of my health problems.

My hope was to at least be able to calm my wildly reactive skin at the surface level.

This luxurious cleansing balm breaks down the day's buildup and rinses so beautifully that I've used it for both face and body as all of the skin on this sweet body has become *practically* hydrophobic.

For the face, I use this as part of a double cleanse with a brilliant enzymatic rice powder that turns into this lovely marshmallow-y cleanser.

And finish with a rice cream moisturizer to seal in the feeling of gently exfoliated, baby soft skin.

Rice skincare has been an absolute game-changer for me and my dry, flaky, rosacea-prone, eczema-prone skin.

Hoping next to switch out my witch hazel and mineral sunscreen for a rice-based toner and rice-based sunscreen formulated for dry skin... yes, they do exist <3

customer_review-R2QDXQHJ81R9H4,B0B3R661JP,Reminds me of Lilah B but without the fragrance! üòç,5.0,"August 1, 2024",Kathryn Magendie,1,"I loved my Lilah B cleansing balm so much I was sad when they went out of business. The only thing was Lilah B had a strong fragrance added, but it was a beautiful fragrance so I didn't mind.

I haven't found one that matched that perfect feeling of spreading on my facial skin smoothly and then turning to a beautiful oil-like texture and then washing away cleanly. I'm sure they are out there, I just didn't find one that I liked or compared to LB. Until this Beauty of Joseon cleansing balm!

I do love everything BOJ, so I am biased :) but this cleansing balm goes on so beautifully, spreads easily, and turns to a gorgeous texture on my skin. Easy to wash away. No fragrance, which is great if you have sensitive skin.

I don't double cleanse in the morning - I use BOJ ginger cleansing oil, which I also love as it cleans my face without drying it out. But, when I wear sunscreen and/or makeup, I will double cleanse. I use this balm first and then follow up with their Green Plum cleansing gel.

I have slight rosacea-prone skin and this does not irritate it. In face, the BOJ line is helping my rosacea - in particular their green tea serum calms the redness (along with CosRx snail mucin -gross but effective!).

And the price is so reasonable like all of BOJ products.

I need to order backups!",12,2025-04-15 12:32:42

I have rosacea and atopic dermatitis, and allergies and sensitive eyes and - well, you get the idea. Actually, it's the sensitive eyes that may be the biggest problem: finding cleansers that remove what I need them to without having to rub the crap out of my skin and without burning my eyes is pretty tricky for me. But this feels amazing. It sounds cheesy, but I really do feel like I'm having a little spa treatment when I use it, and I enjoy doing a facial massage. It rinses off very easily, leaving no residue.

customer_review-R2YYCMGTK3QEB5,B0B3R661JP,"Unscented, Easy to Use",5.0,"April 10, 2024",Abby,1,"I bought this for travel. I usually use a face oil but felt that having a cleansing balm in solid form is easier to toss into a travel bag. This melts and spreads easily on the skin and includes a little paddle for you to scoop out the balm.

Before I apply makeup to my face, I will apply it to the back of my hand. This easily takes off Bobby Brown eyeliner gel make up and MAC concealer makeup. Once I saw that, I knew that this was a winner.

This won‚Äôt necessarily dissolve your mascara, though. If I wear mascara, I reach for a facial oil because that has the power to dissolve the mascara after a bit of gentle massage. To dissolve mascara using this, you need to use a bit more than usual, and have patience when massaging this into your lashes to break down the mascara. It will take a little more time and work compared to a facial oil, but it can be done.

I highly recommend this if you travel and don‚Äôt want to worry about a facial oil leaking in your luggage. If you wear a lot of mascara, I recommend you pack a small amount of facial oil (put it in a Ziplock baggie and a plastic bag to prevent leaks) to help break down the mascara.",8,2025-04-15 12:32:45

Mascara is always a bit tough. I use the Heroine make super waterproof mascara or the Clio Kill Lash mascara and if you have tried those mascaras you know what a PAIN they are to remove. Using coconut oil or olive oil won't make the mascara budge but they are not cosmetically formulated so using plain oil clogged my pores and I was afraid of creating stys. This will melt off the mascara but you have to give it a second to work. I like to emulsify the balm all over my face and then tackle the eyes by loading up the product (once melted) on my eyes, concentrating on the lashes. I massage my lashes for 20 seconds or so before gently wiping the lashes in a downwards motion. After rinsing and following up with a water based cleanser, I'm free from makeup!",0,2025-04-15 12:32:51

The reviews are right: this is gentle, luxurious, moisturizing, and incredible effective at removing dirt, sunscreen, and makeup (in my case, skin tints to cover up redness).

My skin felt like butter afterwards, but in a good way. It was soft and silky whilst not being greasy. It washes off with just water incredibly well without needing to use any cotton pads or a towel. Just put the balm on dry skin, rub it in for around 2-3 minutes, and wash it off with water (whether that be in your sink or your shower). I, personally, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like need to use a water-based cleanser afterwards, but it never hurts to go in with a regular facial cleanser to really make sure you‚Äôve removed any remaining residue/dirt/oil (though it does this well by itself).

It has no fragrance/smell and the ingredient list looks to be good, with no harsh or irritating ingredients to be found. A solid product overall. Definitely give this a try!",29,2025-04-15 12:32:51

Not ideal!!

So I've been wanting to try out a cleansing balm that rinses a bit cleaner and doesn't stay oily and mess up my pipes.

So far so good! A little of this stuff goes a long way, which is nice. It smells nice, has nice packaging, easy to use, gets my makeup and daytime lotions and potions off, then I follow with a wipe or micellar water and we're good to go for nighttime lotions and potions! (I only use it at night.)

Overall, very successful! I'll likely repurchase whenever I run out, but I don't anticipate that being any time soon because you truly don't need to use very much so this container will likely last me like 6-9 months.",23,2025-04-15 12:32:54

This product is nice because it does not have Ethylhexyl Palmitate which can be irritating (though who knows b/c it is not on the skin long), but more importantly it is not derived from palm oil which has negative consequences for the environment. Helps remove sunscreen decently and is comparable to the other balms I listed.

Here is my routine: 1) w/ clean hands, apply to dry face 2) massage for ~1', emulsify the balm with a bit of water and massage lightly for 30"" 3) Follow up with a 2nd cleanser to ensure all product is removed.",16,2025-04-15 12:32:56
