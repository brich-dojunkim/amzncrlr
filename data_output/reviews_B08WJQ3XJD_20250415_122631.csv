customer_review-R2X6MN78QAZWS0,B08WJQ3XJD,Excellent & Cruelty Free!,5.0,"April 11, 2025",C. Byer,1,"I love this moisturizer. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy, but it’s thick enough to work as a night cream. It’s very hydrating—and remember, hydration is crucial for preventing wrinkles.

I also really appreciate that this brand is cruelty free, although, it is a little strange that this is not indicated anywhere on the product packaging. However, I did my own research and have confirmed that this product and brand are indeed cruelty free.

Overall, I find this to be completely worth the price. It’s an excellent value, and my skin definitely looks younger and feels softer since I have started using it.",0,2025-04-15 12:26:04

I can say right away that it provides much better hydration compared to products I've bought in the US. It makes my skin feel soft and absorbs rapidly without leaving any residue. The value is excellent for the quantity you receive. Since starting the K-Beauty BOJ line, my friends have commented that my skin looks “dewy” and it gives my complexion a lovely glow. -Kristie",3,2025-04-15 12:26:04
customer_review-R1POTHYILL0QV5,B08WJQ3XJD,"A Hydrating, Brightening Marvel for Your Skin",5.0,"February 15, 2025",Forough,1,"I recently tried the Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream, and it has quickly become one of my favorite moisturizers. This cream beautifully blends traditional Korean herbal ingredients (Hanbang) with modern skincare benefits, making it an excellent choice for hydration, brightening, and overall skin health.

Texture & Absorption

The cream has a silky, lightweight gel-cream texture that feels luxurious on the skin. Despite being deeply hydrating, it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. It leaves a healthy, dewy glow without making the skin look overly shiny, making it perfect for both day and night use.

Hydration & Moisture

With key ingredients like rice bran water, ginseng root extract, and niacinamide, this cream provides long-lasting hydration while brightening the skin and improving elasticity. My skin feels plump, soft, and well-nourished after using it, and it helps with dry patches without clogging pores.

Skin Benefits

✔ Brightens and evens out skin tone
✔ Provides deep hydration without heaviness
✔ Soothes and strengthens the skin barrier
✔ Works well under makeup for a smooth base

Scent & Packaging

The cream has a light, herbal-floral scent that fades quickly after application. The packaging is minimalist and elegant, but the jar can appear less full due to the air-sealed packaging process.

Best For:

✔ Normal to dry skin looking for deep hydration
✔ Combination skin needing moisture without heaviness
✔ Sensitive skin, thanks to its calming and non-irritating formula

Final Verdict

The Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream is an amazing all-in-one moisturizer that hydrates, brightens, and soothes the skin. If you’re looking for a luxurious, effective, and affordable moisturizer, this is definitely worth trying!",25,2025-04-15 12:26:04

5.0 for BOJ being a gorgeous brand
5.0 for unscented
3.0 for sticky quality

I adore Beauty of Joseon, and have quite a few of their products that I use and those products work so well with my skin. I usually have nothing negative to say about BOJ. But just as with any skincare, you usually won't absolutely always love every single product. And that's the case with this Dynasty cream.

On the plus side, it's so silky soft. It a joy to apply to my face. It has a serum quality to it. While it feels lightweight and serum or gel-like mixed with cream, it is 'heavier' than it feels/appears.

But, something in this formula does become somewhat sticky. I am used to some of my serums being sticky and I don't mind so much since I'll be putting something on top of them to seal those in. But this is often the last step other than my SPF if I am leaving the house, so it will be atop my skin.

I am so on the fence about this cream! I love it and love that it's unscented and love the serum silky feel, but that stickiness is a bit off-putting.

I pat it on and press and when I press I really notice that sticky quality. But it does finally absorb and that's great! Just have to give it time.

One big plus for me, now that I think about it, is that when I put my thick mineral SPF over this moisturizer, my sunscreen goes on a little easier.

I am not sure if I would order this again. I have reordered many BOJ products - their glow serums, their ginseng essence, their ginseng oil cleanser to name a few, but I am going to see what other moisturizers they offer or if none maybe checkout something from CosRx or another brand. But, since I am such a fan of their beautiful products, I may just order it again anyway!",43,2025-04-15 12:26:10

I've generally been happy and satisfied with my whole routine for awhile now... except for my moisturizer. Maybe I'm just picky, but I've tried every brand you can think of and never really wanted to settle on any of them. Everything from cheap drugstore moisturizers, to viral TikTok brands, to overly-priced luxury products--all of which just 'did the job' at best. However, I've been a huge fan of this brand's other products for a long time now so I figured I should finally give their moisturizer a try!

Safe to say that I love love love it! Between being a full-time college student and working a full-time job, there's been a couple days lately where I didn't do any skincare at ALL with how busy I've been. Yet this moisturizer has kept my skin feeling great despite DAYS without washing my face (which I know definitely isn't ideal...I'm trying my best, I swear haha).

A lot of people dislike the texture, saying it's a little sticky. But I've had no problems with it. In fact, I really feel like if you're following through with a proper skincare routine and ensuring that you're not using any products that shouldn't be used together, then you shouldn't have any issue with it.

I genuinely have no complaints. I'm confident in saying that this is the best all-around moisturizer I've EVER used--and I think it's going to be a long time before I find anything that can beat this.",42,2025-04-15 12:26:19

customer_review-R1YFFOJKJUSJE6,B08WJQ3XJD,BOJ Convert,5.0,"September 24, 2024",Kindle Customer,1,"Hi, I'm a true convert to the Beauty of Joseon skincare lifestyle. I use their plum cleanser, alpha arbutin serum, gentle makeup remover, and their dynasty moisturizer. Before, I was using a subscription box called Curology and after a while I stopped because it wasn't within my financial means to keep paying for the subscription. I was worried I wouldn't find a good replacement of products that provided me with the current clear, smooth, and healthy skin I maintained while on Curology. But let me tell you that all these products from BOJ have definitely aided in transforming my skin in a good way! I am definitely going to buy more from BOJ because I know that using these products continually have helped in giving me better skin. I only have hormonal breakouts now due to my time of the month but other than that I'm acne free with these products and they're gentle enough that they don't irritate my eczema. My hyperpigmentation marks are also fading. I feel like with continued use of these products I am closer to achieving the infamous Korean glass skin. Their moisturizer in particular is very hydrating and melts in your skin. Perfect for night time use or in the winter months. Sometimes my skin can be pretty flakey when I use retinoids, so the dynasty cream really helps me to retain moisture.",20,2025-04-15 12:26:24

The first time I used it, I’ll never forget how luxurious it felt and it was like my skin drank it right up, rather than it just sitting on top like the moisturizer I used to use from Lush. I don’t feel greasy at all, just hydrated.

customer_review-RESUJ5QCCX53V,B08WJQ3XJD,I think my skin burn by this product,4.0,"June 28, 2023",Kai Kiu,1,"I'm a skincare beginner with combination skin. I've heard many positive comments about this product, so I decided to give it a try. Initially, I didn't have high expectations and applied it after my serum. However, within the first few minutes, it caused a burning or minty sensation on the edges of my face, like my jaw and near my ears. My mom also tried it, and her skin burned quite badly, but like mine, it stopped after a few minutes and left a minty sensation in the air around our faces. I'm not sure if this is the intended effect of a moisturizer, but I personally don't like it. Despite that, I thought I would be okay and give my skin some time to adapt. The product also became somewhat sticky, but I can tolerate that. On the positive side, I do like how it stays on my face throughout the day and night, giving my skin a glowing appearance. However, I dislike the recurring burning sensation every time I apply it, even though it's not painful. Ultimately, the only aspect I don't like about it is that I believe the ingredients are not suitable for both me and my mom ( my mom has oily skin.) However, I'm uncertain whether the moisturizer was mixed with other products that caused this effect or if it's an issue with my skin. The cleanser, toner, and serum I use are all from Beauty of Joseon because I believed their vegan ingredients would be suitable for my skin. The cleanser is called ""Green Plum Refreshing,"" the toner is ""Green Plum Refreshing AHA+BHA,"" and the serum is ""Calming Green Tea+Panthenol."" This moisturizer is also from the same brand. Beside this commment is this a good kit for beginners??",21,2025-04-15 12:26:27

customer_review-R2REYPGWIXAOKM,B08WJQ3XJD,Great for Sensitive Skin!!!,5.0,"July 19, 2023",White Rabbit Reviews,1,"If any of you have read my previous skincare reviews, you know how sensitive my skin is. Redness, itchiness, attractive eczema blotches from gentle products like Eucerin and Cerave even! I sometimes feel like my skin is an entity of its own- a very irritable, temperamental beast attached to my underlying organs.

In comes Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream-- I saw it in a youtube video from someone with very sensitive skin and decided to give it a try without high hopes at all. How could this work on my skin, if Eucerin ""approved for sensitive skin by dermatologists"" causes me to look like I got a bad sunburn?

I patch tested this first and noticed no redness or blotchiness or itching, so decided to slather it on my entire face the next day, preparing to have to stay home for a week of damage control. Instead, I noticed my skin drank it up and became glowy, dewy, and moisturized! I tried it for a few weeks without any reaction!

This cream works WONDERS on my dry, sensitive skin! It is one of the two night creams that I reach for every night- this and the Cerave night cream (one of only 2 Cerave products that don't cause my skin to look like it was attacked by a feral beast).

I highly recommend this night cream for anyone who has rosacea, eczema, or inflamed skin that reacts to EVERYTHING! I think it is reasonably priced as well- I usually have to repurchase every couple months or so, which isn't terrible. I have to replace my Cerave night cream more often, which is only 5 dollars cheaper than this.

I will provide an update if my skin changes its mind, but for a few months now, it's been a dream come true for me!!!!",55,2025-04-15 12:26:27
