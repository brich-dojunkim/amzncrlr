customer_review-R1U0RL5Q959G0N,B01CVXRAVK,Amazing smell and lather,5.0,"October 26, 2024",Stephanie S,1,I know it’s detailed as being earthy but they should update the fragrance because this doesn’t give earthy as much as it gives woodsy. I liken this to a santal or sandalwood. Either way it’s lovely and very moisturizing.,0,2025-04-15 12:41:20
customer_review-RHNOGIOFKKY0H,B01CVXRAVK,A Little Goes A Long Way!,5.0,"November 10, 2023",Adventure Cat,1,"This product smells great, lathers up nicely and leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky. Fair warning, the pump is very powerful so be careful when using the pump otherwise you’ll have too much product coming out at once. The scent seems powerful at first but after you rinse and dry off the scent is there but it isn’t overpowering or overwhelming. It is a mild pine scent.",2,2025-04-15 12:41:20
customer_review-R3E201PB8L1475,B01CVXRAVK,hydrating body wash,4.0,"April 11, 2023",babyanimal,0,"This body wash has a light fresh scent. It has a watery texture but it lathers well. The scent is not very strong so you can't really smell it during the shower so it feels scentless for the most part. What I like about this body wash is that it feels very moisturizing. My skin feels very clean and smooth afterward. I did feel like I had to use more of the body wash because of the watery texture so I didn't think it was a good value for a body wash, however, it really feels like a good quality body wash so this is the case where quality trumps quantity.",0,2025-04-15 12:41:20
customer_review-RR216T85114WU,B01CVXRAVK,Silky gentle and effective,5.0,"November 30, 2024",LCStone,1,"Love BOJ products and this one does not disappoint either. I have been using Pyunkang Yul shower gel and it’s really great, but BOJ feels creamier a more concentrated. It does have some fragrance but it’s slight. I am loving it and would recommend it.",0,2025-04-15 12:41:20

customer_review-R2UFB84AWHLPHN,B01CVXRAVK,Pine Grove body wash,4.0,"April 10, 2023",FL Reviewer,0,"This is actually a very nice body wash. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. The scent is extremely light in the pine department. It's very slight, but then there is a floral note to it. It is a unique scent and smells quite pretty. It's not super strong or overly fragrant, but it is a light scent and not too light. It is a little bit on the liquidy side and the pump is a little funky to use in that it kind of squirts it out in an odd fashion. But it is very nice wash and it lathers up very well.",0,2025-04-15 12:41:24
customer_review-R1ZSKOCBQIBA8O,B01CVXRAVK,Good soap but not a fan of the smell,3.0,"April 23, 2023",lisa makowski,0,This is a really good soap and it lathers great with just a couple pumps but it more of a piney woodsy smell for a man,2,2025-04-15 12:41:24

customer_review-R6QTW1PANIXLZ,B01CVXRAVK,Expensive,4.0,"April 6, 2023",Z,0,"I have just started using this so I will not be able to tell if this is really helping with anti aging.

It is a nicely packaged, pine scented body wash. Packaging, pump is nice, ingredients are correctly listed.

My only complain is the price. The current $25 includes shipping, but I would say that unless you are looking for product exactly matching the parameters of this one, you can find reasonable body washes in your local store for much cheaper (of course, without shipping).",0,2025-04-15 12:41:24
customer_review-R288XJR1QZL0XX,B01CVXRAVK,Beauty of Joseon Pine Grove Body Wash 13.52 oz,5.0,"April 8, 2023",M. Hill,0,A product of Korea this body wash has a complex but subtle earthy pine scent that is suitable for all users. The 13.52 ounce manual pump plastic bottle nozzle has a broad base so even with slippery hands it operates reliably although the texture is thin. It could be an issue with just the bottle I received but the body wash squirted out with intensity so keep hand or mesh loofah close to the spout to avoid inadvertently wasting the product. The body wash lathers and rinses well and does not leave skin feeling tight and dry—and the scent is excellent.,0,2025-04-15 12:41:24
customer_review-R2OKF88A8F0VIZ,B01CVXRAVK,Nice pleasant fragrance,3.0,"April 10, 2023",Jijnasu Forever,0,Lathers well with a loofah. Pleasant smell that is light. Lingers for a couple of hours. Cleans well without drying the skin. But price/value is not compelling at all. Many brand name body washes with essential oils are available to try out before splurging 25$.,0,2025-04-15 12:41:24
customer_review-R2A33QVGJE6LFG,B01CVXRAVK,Thin and pricey.,3.0,"April 16, 2023",$earching 4 deals,0,I have heard people hype up this brand. Maybe other products are better. But I felt this Beauty of Joseon Pine Grove : Body Wash was just average. The body wash has a thinness to it much more so than other body washes I have used. I am not a fan of strong pine scents and this one luckily didn’t smell like a pine forest or holiday tree. Can’t quite pin down the actual scent though. This body wash does lather some and will do what a body wash does…get you clean. But it will also clean out your wallet as it is pricey for what it is. I can buy 2 or 3 other brands that work just as well or better for cheaper.,0,2025-04-15 12:41:24

customer_review-RK43P4H88J9U7,B01CVXRAVK,smells nice,5.0,"April 22, 2023",Elysa,0,The body wash had a pleasant woodsy scent. It had a generous lather and it didn't dry out my skin. The body wash washed out cleanly and left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I love how big the bottle was and the minimalist vibe it had.,0,2025-04-15 12:41:24
customer_review-R2WYENB2NSEBR4,B01CVXRAVK,Clean earthy scent of pine and flowers is calming and addictive,5.0,"April 8, 2023",Sandra Trolinger,0,"This is a simply packaged bottle of silky cleansing body wash that lathers well and rinses clean.
The scent is strong with pine dominating and then the subtle fragrance of fresh flowers filters through.
The pump bottle is easy to use but dispenses a huge amount.
I am a fan of the beautiful scent and how well it lathers as a little goes a long way and cleanses my skin leaving it feeling moisturized.",0,2025-04-15 12:41:29
customer_review-R11LB7FXHUH5A4,B01CVXRAVK,Fresh and clean,5.0,"April 7, 2023",Lisa J.,0,"The fragrance of this is lovely, and IMHO unisex. Just lightly green and subtly piney or mossy, and a touch of rain, like walking through a wooded Glen during a sunshower. Not intensely scented at all, but really pleasant. Lather is luxurious without feeling soapy or oily, but with no drying either. Skin just feels like me without anything added, which is really nice. Very light and clean and slightly invigorating. Very happy, and want to try other scents of this line.",0,2025-04-15 12:41:29
customer_review-R2UC7CSJXH3N6,B01CVXRAVK,"Earthy, Beautiful Scent!",5.0,"April 6, 2023",Tank Girl,0,"I ADORE this body wash for a number of reasons. First, it lathers beautifully! Second, it washes away without leaving a slippery residue or film behind. Third, it smells excellent! It has an almost herbal/earthy undertone to it. It smells really good! I love how it leaves my skin feeling and looking. Would recommend, especially at the price point of under 20 dollars.",0,2025-04-15 12:41:29
customer_review-R30B8AR8TZMU5I,B01CVXRAVK,"Great scent, good lather, rinses clean.. good overall body wash!",5.0,"April 8, 2023",Charles K.,0,"This body wash has a nice pleasant pine tree scent, not too powerful and stays on for awhile. The lather is rich and foamy, and most important for me easy to rinse off, no residue, leaves you clean and fresh. If I had any complaint, it would be that the selling price ($25 when I ordered) is a tad high for the amount you get.",0,2025-04-15 12:41:30
