customer_review-R1VXNR3CGF2HV,B0B45M89LX,Impressed After First Use!,5.0,"July 31, 2024",Angela R.,1,"I'm on a mission to seek out and try the best Korean skincare products that work for my skin, and so far this cleansing oil did wonders on my first use! I usually wait before writing reviews, so I can try out my purchases at least a few times. I felt compelled to share my experience after just one use!

I never knew a cleansing oil was necessary, and always wondered why influencers used so many products. Well it is a total game changer, especially if you combine it with a foaming cleanser afterwards. The deep pore foaming cleanser I used is from Anua, and it paired very well with this cleansing oil. I believe Joseon has something similar, but in a gel form. I will try that once I run out of Anua.

I first used the cleansing oil, and gently applied it to my face in circular motions. I focused on my T-zone for a few minutes to see if it made a difference in helping clear out my blackheads on my nose and forehead. I'm glad it doesn't leave an oily residue after rinsing. This cleansing oil melted off my make-up in a gentle manner and with no burning eyes. My skin didn't feel stripped either!

After cleansing oil, I followed with the Anua Heartleaf deep pore foaming cleanser. I grabbed my 10x mirror to see my nose, and holy cow my blackheads were pretty much gone! My pores looked very clean and I was so happy. If this is just one use so far, I cannot wait to see my results in the long run.

The smell of this product is of ginseng, and yes it may bother people, but it didn't bother me and it's a scent that doesn't last on your face. So, if your sensitive to scents, then this might not be for you.

Bottom Line: This cleansing oil will be my holy grail as long is it is offered!",39,2025-04-15 12:31:38

I‚Äôm Asian so obviously I would gravitate for anything Asian/korean skincare. I have a dry/sesnsitive skin and this is very gentle while cleanse thing well. My daughter has the other type of skin but she used just about anything on ticktock. She really likes this. Her friend tried and took same and was surprised how it control the oil for them. They are very sport active so their sweat is different than mine. They didn‚Äôt; break outs but more clarified skin. We ran out and she found this on amazon. I was surprised and found that this brand is very popular that I wasn‚Äôt aware of. The smell is just right for me. It‚Äôs has a light old/aged bourbon to me.

customer_review-R2A4PLEKVUYWLQ,B0B45M89LX,Not bad!,5.0,"October 11, 2024",Della,1,"Edit: Okay, so I have decided to edit after a few days of using this cleansing oil, and give it the other ‚≠ê, because I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! Since writing my first review, I have discovered just how beautiful this cleansing oil really is. I wipe my face with warm water on a makeup wash cloth, put a couple of pumps of the oil in my hand, and just drip a few drops of warm water onto the oil in my hand, and immediately, it starts to turn like...creamy and white - not a frothy foam, but like milk in my hands. Then, I massage the creamy oil into my skin, and it doesn't really lather, so much as it seems to just become no longer oily. When I wipe it away, it leaves my skin just so...CLEAN and soft, but not feeling like it has stripped my face of all moisture like my benzoyl peroxide face wash does. It's bouncy and dewy and smooth. The other up side is that I don't have to wash my under eye areas separately with a gentle cleanser (I was using baby shampoo before buying this cleanser, and washing it first so that I didn't get benzoyl peroxide into my delicate under eye areas, which would have dried it out and caused worse fine lines). I can use this oil to gently wash my under eye area with my finger tips and to wash off my eye makeup if I'm wearing any, because it is so gentle and it adds moisture, instead of taking it away. My skin hasn't looked this good in decades - if EVER! I'm 41, and my skin looks better than it did at 31...or 21 for that matter, because for the first time in I can't remember when, I have ZERO blemishes, and - TMI, but: I'm in that point in my cycle when I'm usually having the worst breakouts, but not a single pimple or blackhead or bump of any kind. NOTHING has done so much for my skin as this oil has. Not retinol, not salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide not an expensive cream or serum - nothing!

I used to DREAD washing my face, because I had to take care not to get any under my eyes or on my neck, and had to thoroughly get all of it off when rinsing, etc, but this cleansing oil has turned my least favorite part of my skin care routine into my FAVORITE part! And I no longer dislike the smell; I now associate it with the lovely experience. I WILL be reordering! I'm even contemplating buying one to use in the shower! Seriously.

If you are interested in trying an oil-based face wash, but you're an oily or combination skin type, THIS is the one to try! It's now ESSENTIAL to my skin care routine. Did I say I LOVE it?!

Original review: So, first of all, I'm VERY impressed with the shipping. I ordered it after 11am, and it was on my porch by 4. Having two toddlers and no time to leave the house, that is just VERY convenient.

On to its quality: it feels very light and left my skin feeling clean and soft, and did not make me greasy. I did enjoy the spa-like feeling, too. It wiped clean with just warm water and a microfiber towel that's made for makeup removal.

However, my biggest issue is with the smell. It stinks. BUT, as a girl who grew up on the border of Appalachia and the Midwest, I recognize that smell: it's ginseng. While I don't usually desire scents in my skin care products, I would probably have approved of some modification of the smell of this particular product. That said, I'm going to continue using it BECAUSE of the ginseng and its antioxidant properties...but I'll probably follow it up with a toner that DOESN'T stink. lol

I'm an oily skin girl, and so far I don't think it's going to make things worse - especially since I'm still in the 6-8 week retinol purge, so not much CAN make it worse...ugh! AND my skin probably needs the addition of oil to prevent any dryness retinol may cause later on down the road.

I'm going to use this product up, and I'll decide when it gets close to empty whether or not I'm going to reorder. So far, so good. Excellent price for what you get too, so if you're looking for an effective oil cleanser that isn't just canola or coconut oil that will leave you greasy, this is the one.

Time will tell, and I'll be back - good or bad.",48,2025-04-15 12:31:38
customer_review-R2D2610MLY7CX0,B0B45M89LX,Does not work well in removing makeup and smell is unpleasant,3.0,"September 11, 2024",Amazon Customer,1,"I‚Äôve used this cleansing oil for almost a year as I bought multiple bottles initially.
Pros: it works well as a gentle cleanser and does not dry out/strip your skin (as you would expect with a cleansing oil).
Affordable and lasts a very long time.

Cons: I mainly bought it to do the heavy lifting with removing my makeup and it did not do such a great job. I had to either cleanse with this oil twice to remove majority of the makeup followed by a different cleanser or micellar water or use more of the micellar water if using it once. Also if you use it heavily on your eyes, it would sting. For reference, I don‚Äôt use a lot of make up just tinted moisturizer, mascara and blush/bronzer.
It does have an added fragrance, but it does have a scent (maybe the natural scent of the ginseng oil) that kind of reminded me of gasoline, which I really disliked.

Personally for me, I won‚Äôt be purchasing it again.",13,2025-04-15 12:31:38
customer_review-R1TICWF41CEK80,B0B45M89LX,Beauty of Joseon is a lovely brand,5.0,"July 13, 2024",Kathryn Magendie,1,"Beauty of Joseon is fast becoming my most favorite K-Beauty (or any other skincare) Brand! They are getting a lot of attention lately but they've been around a while. Their products are gorgeous and so reasonably priced.

I have aging skin so cleansing oils work very well for me. I use them in the morning as the very first step in my skincare routine.

Apply a bit to dry skin and gently work it onto your face. Then add a bit of water and gently work that in. I rinse my face with tepid water - never hot! - about 10 times, and then give my face 4 or 5 splashes of cold water. I then tone, let my skin dry, pat and press on my vitamin c, let that absorb, and then the rest of my routine.

This cleanser goes on so smoothly and leaves my skin happy and non-irritated, but still clean. It does have a bit of a scent but it's not strong and it's not off-putting to me as it is to some - I rather like I t- and as well it quickly dissipates.

I am excited to try their balm and their gel cleanser for evenings when I want a deeper cleansing.

I've used other Beauty of Joseon products -like their ginseng essence - and love the brand. Reasonably priced too.

If you have dry aging skin, give cleansing oils a try. If you've worn sunscreen and/or makeup, you would want to double cleanse and maybe use a cleansing balm instead of this oil, but this is great on its own in the morning.",21,2025-04-15 12:31:38
customer_review-R1BT91E47DEJPL,B0B45M89LX,Great oil cleanser for removing face sunscreen and makeup,5.0,"April 1, 2025",Kathy,1,Great oil cleanser! I use this in the shower to remove my face sunscreen and makeup. The key to any oil cleanser is to work it in to dry skin first and THEN add water to emulsify it. I rinse it off completely and then follow up with a salicylic face wash. I use two pumps so it lasts a long time for me--I'd estimate about 4-5 months honestly :) I have normal-oily skin and I break out pretty easily if I introduce a product to my routine that doesn't agree with my skin. This has never caused any breakouts for me. I don't notice a strong fragrance either. Great value for the price! I've repurchased three times and will continue to repurchase.,0,2025-04-15 12:31:39

It‚Äôs oil ‚Äî Duh! If you‚Äôre acne prone, use it for double cleansing with something else that treats acne (salicylic acid or benzoyl perioxide face wash). Wash with oil first; rinse; then use acne wash. I made the mistake of not double cleansing the first time I used this and, of course, developed a pimple within the day. This product has coconut oil and I‚Äôve always broken out if I leave raw coconut oil on my skin.

The smell, to me, is that of Tea Tree Oil but I don‚Äôt see any in the ingredients. I do agree that soybean oil is a cheap byproduct and that, if there‚Äôs a heavy scent in the product, that perhaps they are trying to hide a rancid oil smell.

Otherwise, I actually very much liked this product prior to reading the nasty reviews!",10,2025-04-15 12:31:44

customer_review-R1XVQPXFHDFO4,B0B45M89LX,game changer for skin care!!,5.0,"July 21, 2023",Kristen Barnes,1,"I recently purchased the Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil and it has been a game-changer in my skincare routine. I've been on the hunt for a cleansing oil that effectively removes makeup, purifies my skin, and doesn't leave any oily residue - and I've finally found it!

The first thing I noticed was the packaging. The bottle is beautifully designed, with a nod to traditional Korean aesthetics that is in line with the brand's heritage. It's both practical and pretty on my bathroom shelf.

The oil itself is rich and luxurious, with a lovely subtle scent. The ginseng ingredient is what really caught my attention. Ginseng is known for its rejuvenating properties and antioxidants, and it's not often you find it in a cleansing oil. This product not only cleanses but also nurtures my skin, making it feel revitalized and refreshed.

Applying the oil is a treat in itself. It feels silky smooth on my skin, and it effortlessly dissolves makeup, dirt, and grime from the day. Unlike some other cleansing oils I've used, this one doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. Instead, my skin feels clean, supple, and incredibly hydrated.

What impressed me most, however, was the absence of a greasy residue. The Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil rinses off easily with warm water, leaving no oily film behind. My skin feels clean and soft, not slick or oily.

I‚Äôve also noticed my skin looking brighter and more youthful since I started using this cleansing oil. The dullness I used to see has been replaced by a healthy glow, which I attribute to the nourishing ginseng and other beneficial ingredients in the formula.

Moreover, this product is wonderfully gentle. I have sensitive skin and I appreciate that this product didn't cause any irritation or breakouts. It's also worth noting that Beauty of Joseon prides itself on using high-quality, clean ingredients and this product is no exception.

In conclusion, the Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil is an innovative, high-quality product that delivers on its promises. It offers a thorough cleanse while also nurturing the skin with beneficial ingredients. It's a fantastic addition to any skincare routine and I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a gentle yet effective cleansing oil.

Have been using Ponds and/or Cerave for the past decade. Just wanted to try something different sometimes.

The ginseng scent took a little bit of time to get used to, even as a person who loves ginseng. Not bad, just not something typically encountered in skincare. But honestly nowadays I don‚Äôt even notice it. Great at removing makeup. I don‚Äôt even double cleanse most days. Leaves me feeling cleaner, lighter, and less try than Ponds and Cerave alone. Feels very similar to DHC, nothing mind blowing. Would buy again if it‚Äôs cheaper than DHC.",0,2025-04-15 12:31:51

customer_review-R1IDMK7523MG4F,B0B45M89LX,Efficient for Double-Cleansing - but Heavy Oil Scent and Leaking Pump,3.0,"October 10, 2023",Jennifer,1,"I use this oil as the first step in my double-cleansing process. The oil itself has a slightly-heavy viscosity, which I prefer more than some of the other oil-cleansers I've tried with a thinner consistency. The thickness of the oil is perfect for lasting through my facial massages, which I gently do with a small facial cleansing mitt.

The oil transforms into a milky liquid once it comes into contact with water, and easily rinses away - but it does leave a slight film on my face after removal. I've no issue with this, however, as I follow-up my oil cleansing with another foaming or acidic cleanser.

My first concern with this oil is its scent. Given that the primary ingredient in the product is soybean oil, I'd expect to notice *some* aroma of the oil itself. But this product has one of the heavier ""oily"" scents I've smelled when using an oil cleanser (and I've used multiple types from different brands). While the scent isn't offensive, and doesn't cause me to have an allergic reaction? I'd prefer a more understated and elegant scent profile from this product - especially considering the elegantly minimalistic appearance of the bottle.

My second concern is the pump mechanism on the bottle. About a quarter of the way through the bottle's contents, my nozzle began to release oil from the base area where the pump depresses into the bottle. This happens each time I pump the nozzle. Not only does this waste product, it causes me to have to clean the exterior of the bottle after each use.

If not for the scent and the pumping issue, I'd include this oil in my regular rotation of daily skincare products - as it does a wonderful job of cleansing and providing ""slip"" for my face massages. But I won't repurchase this item as there are simply other products on the market where I don't experience these usability issues.",43,2025-04-15 12:31:51

While this completely does easily take off all my makeup and sunscreen, (without causing acne breakouts or milia, which I am prone to both), it does take a bit more product to dispense in order to have a sufficient amount for both my face and neck. I've tried other Korean cleansing oils (cheaper than this one even) and was able to successfully remove all dirt and products with simply one pump. Personally, this one takes 2 full pumps (which I would like to mention the pump speed is quite faster than others, which I feel sometimes wastes or accidentally gives me too much product).

The smell is strong but surprisingly pleasant if you don‚Äôt mind an earthy scent.
Above all, this left my skin better than it found it. It truly gets into every crevice and pore and detoxes my face - I can feel the oil and dirt being pulled every time I massage it in. I usually wash it off with a gentle cleanser after and my skin is left incredibly soft and plump. It also didn‚Äôt break me out - I have sensitive skin, but this is not irritating at all.

customer_review-R3QCJFPMAEEO49,B0B45M89LX,"No scent, easy to emulsify, feels nice but not for acne prone. *UPDATED*",3.0,"July 10, 2023",Sara,1,"I recently tried out the Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil with high hopes for the ""double-cleansing"" method. It really does make your skin glow and feel soft, but it of course made me break out. While my experience wasn't entirely negative, I can't help but come back to warn my fellow acne friends that may be guided here because of skinfluencers.

Starting with the positives, I was pleased to discover that the cleansing oil is fragrance-free despite seeing some reviews about the scent. This is a definite plus for those who are sensitive to scents or prefer their skincare products to be scentless. The ingredient list also caught my attention. True to its word, the oil did leave my skin feeling more moisturized and supple after use. The natural ingredients seemed promising and aligned with my skincare goals.

However, despite religiously following the double-cleansing routine, this cleansing oil unfortunately triggered painful breakouts on my skin. I had hoped that it would either improve my acne situation or at the very least not exacerbate it. Sadly, this wasn't the case. If anything, I felt that my pores were getting clogged and my breakouts were becoming more persistent and so so red/inflamed.

As we all know skincare can be highly individual, and what works for one person might not work for another. Some people will swear double cleansing can't possibly make you break out because you're washing it off, but I've realized my face can't handle any oil of any kind even though I have combination skin. I'm convinced that double-cleansing does not actually get it all off and you need to triple/quad cleanse, which just doesn't sound efficient or necessary to me.",32,2025-04-15 12:31:54

Now moving on to this oil cleanser. It is advertised for all skin types and ‚Äúwithout clogging skin pores‚Äù. I tend to be on the oily side and I really should be using products that are noncomedogenic (non clogging) but soy bean oil is highly comedogenic and not recommended for oily people, like me.

To the product itself. It feels very light and not thick at all. 3 pumps get the job done. It has an earthy smell but very mild which I personally don‚Äôt mind. It‚Äôs used on dry skin but once in contact with water, it turns this milky white that washes off no problem. It doesn‚Äôt leave my skin feeling dry right after using it.

You don‚Äôt even have to use that much, just rub gently on dry skin and then add some water and voila! I always double cleanse, but if you wanted to you could just use this and your face will be clean.",0,2025-04-15 12:32:03

It definitely got the job done and I don‚Äôt feel like I broke out or anything and was good for sensative skin but there was something I didn‚Äôt like I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on,0,2025-04-15 12:32:06
customer_review-RBNTT3CIJZ6ZS,B0B45M89LX,Gets the job done,4.0,"July 23, 2024",Aishmar,1,"This cleansing oil removes makeup very well. I find it slightly irritating to the eyes, could be fragrance related.",0,2025-04-15 12:32:06
customer_review-R38QTRY5DBKRG4,B0B45M89LX,Soybean oil is comedogenic,4.0,"August 19, 2023",Ty Huynh Chhor,1,"It melts off my tinted mineral sunscreen with ease that DHC cleansing oil doesn‚Äôt do. I didn‚Äôt try it with mascara. It washes off well but does feel greasy after. Some folks say they don‚Äôt feel an after grease - I def feel it. DHC doesn‚Äôt have a greasy after feel and emulsifies really well.

I bought this as cheaper alternative to DHC. I am not sure if I‚Äôll keep this as an always product since it‚Äôs 50% soybean oil which is highly occlusive. I‚Äôm hoping since I double cleanse, this will not cause me to break out. Only time will tell.

There‚Äôs only 1% ginseng so I don‚Äôt think ginseng is doing anything for you. It‚Äôs more of a placebo effect.",44,2025-04-15 12:32:06
customer_review-R3EO3S6A9CDWR4,B0B45M89LX,Perfect for double cleansing,5.0,"August 8, 2024",Amazon Customer,1,This oil cleanser is perfect for my double cleansing routine when followed by the cream cleanser. It leaves my skin so soft and glowy. A little goes a long way so it‚Äôs a good value and good price. The only thing I would point out if you haven‚Äôt tried it is that it has a bit of a strong smell compared to other oil cleansers.,3,2025-04-15 12:32:06
customer_review-R2T9W264TUYTH4,B0B45M89LX,Mediocre at best,3.0,"August 11, 2024",Maegan Million,1,"Does a decent job as a 1st step facial cleanser for makeup and sunscreen, but does not do a great job on mascara removal.

My product also arrived with a non-working pump. I was completely out of my other oil cleanser and needed to use this one upon arrival so I didn‚Äôt pursue a return/replacement.

The smell is slightly off putting, but it‚Äôs a gentle formula with a nice consistency. Wouldn‚Äôt order again, but it will do a mediocre job.",0,2025-04-15 12:32:06

It leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and radiant, with a beautiful flow that lasts. I've also noticed that it effectively cleanses my pores without stripping away moisture, making my skin feel balanced and refreshed.",2,2025-04-15 12:32:06

It‚Äôs not a bad smell, but some may not like that ginger smell. The oil also seemed to feel‚Ä¶ dry? It took off sunscreen but I kept having to emulsify with water or I couldn‚Äôt rub the oil onto my face.",0,2025-04-15 12:32:06
