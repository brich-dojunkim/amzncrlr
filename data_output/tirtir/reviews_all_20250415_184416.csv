customer_review-R2DIZ4O3A34BKY,B0CTC25796,"Brighten and Revive with Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum!""",5.0,"March 9, 2025",Ally smith,1,"I recently started using the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results! With a solid 4.3-star rating and over 8,500 reviews, this eye treatment serum has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine.

This serum combines retinal and niacinamide, two powerful ingredients that work wonders for puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines. After just a few weeks of use, I've noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my under-eye bags and an overall brightening effect. My fine lines have also started to look less pronounced, which is a huge confidence booster!

The lightweight formula absorbs quickly into the skin, making it easy to layer under other products. I’ve been using it both in the morning and at night, and it plays nicely with my other skincare products, including moisturizers and sunscreens. Just be sure to apply it gently and allow it to absorb before layering on additional products.

The packaging is sleek and convenient, with a dropper that allows for precise application. A little goes a long way, so the 30ml size is quite generous and will last for a while.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum to anyone looking to combat puffiness and dark circles while improving the overall texture around the eyes. It’s effective, easy to use, and a fantastic addition to my skincare routine.",24,2025-04-15 17:39:20
customer_review-R3HO73O51UE39,B0CTC25796,Beauty of Joseon Eye Cream – A Miracle for Tired Eyes!,5.0,"February 16, 2025",Siarah,1,"If you’re looking for an eye cream that works instantly, the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum is a total game-changer! The moment you apply it, you can feel it hydrating and refreshing your under-eye area. And the best part? In just 10 minutes, your eye bags are visibly reduced, making you look well-rested and bright-eyed—even if you just woke up.

The formula is lightweight yet super nourishing, absorbing quickly without feeling greasy. It smooths, depuffs, and revitalizes tired eyes, making it perfect for anyone who struggles with dark circles or puffiness. If you need a quick fix for dull, tired eyes, this eye cream works absolute wonders!",29,2025-04-15 17:39:20
customer_review-R390NYNKID6EN9,B0CTC25796,"Great for Wrinkles, Color Correction Good but Tone-Specific",4.0,"February 15, 2025",Jae,1,"My last eye cream wasn't cutting it, so I decided to give this one a try. I'm really glad I did. Within the first week, I noticed a significant reduction in the fine wrinkles around my eyes - something my old Mizon eye cream never did. After that initial improvement, it didn't seem to do much more, but that was still a big win. The color correction aspect was a bit off for my skin tone, so I have to use it sparingly during the day, but it was surprisingly effective at reducing redness. Plus, it feels nice on the skin and doesn't have any strong scent.",22,2025-04-15 17:39:20
customer_review-RAHP8EJMNJEMD,B0CTC25796,"“Gentle, Hydrating, and Brightening: A Must-Have for Tired Eyes!”",5.0,"August 24, 2024",Tisha,1,"Texture and Application: The Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum has a lightweight, silky texture that absorbs quickly into the skin. It’s non-greasy and layers well under makeup, making it a great addition to both morning and nighttime skincare routines. The serum comes with a dropper applicator, which makes it easy to dispense just the right amount without any wastage.

Hydration and Comfort: One of the standout features of this eye serum is its hydrating power. It instantly soothes and moisturizes the delicate skin around the eyes, reducing the appearance of dryness and fine lines. The formula feels refreshing upon application and leaves the skin feeling soft and supple throughout the day.

Ingredients and Benefits: The serum is packed with nourishing ingredients like ginseng extract and retinal, which are known for their anti-aging and brightening properties. Over time, I’ve noticed a visible reduction in dark circles and puffiness, and the skin around my eyes looks brighter and more rejuvenated. The gentle formula is perfect for sensitive skin and doesn’t cause any irritation, which is a huge plus.

Packaging: The packaging is simple yet elegant, with a sturdy glass bottle that feels luxurious. The dropper applicator is hygienic and easy to use, ensuring you can control the amount of product you apply. The size of the bottle is also generous for an eye serum, making it a good value for the price.

Longevity: A little goes a long way with this serum. Just a small amount is enough to cover both eyes, meaning the bottle will last for several months even with daily use. The effects of the serum also seem to improve with consistent use, making it a worthwhile investment for long-term eye care.

Value for Money: Given the quality of the ingredients and the noticeable results, the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum offers excellent value for money. It’s priced reasonably for the benefits it delivers, making it accessible for those looking to add a high-quality eye serum to their skincare routine.

Conclusion: The Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum is a fantastic product that delivers on its promises of hydration, brightening, and anti-aging. Its gentle yet effective formula makes it suitable for all skin types, and the results speak for themselves. If you’re looking for an eye serum that can tackle dark circles, fine lines, and puffiness, this one is definitely worth trying. Highly recommended for anyone looking to revive and refresh their eye area!",98,2025-04-15 17:39:20

customer_review-R26S5V64WD558J,B0CTC25796,"Lightweight Hydration, But Limited Results for Stubborn Under-Eye Concerns",3.0,"October 29, 2024",Philly,1,"The Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum with retinal and niacinamide is a gentle, soothing eye serum that feels luxurious on the skin, but it may fall short in delivering noticeable results for those looking to reduce puffiness, fine lines, or dark circles. The lightweight formula absorbs quickly, leaving the under-eye area feeling hydrated and smooth, which is a nice start to any skincare routine.

While it’s comfortable to apply and offers hydration and mild soothing benefits, it doesn’t seem to provide the targeted effects one might hope for, especially for more stubborn issues like dark circles or deeper wrinkles. The retinal and niacinamide combination is promising, but the results may be subtle and require longer-term use to see any real improvements in tone or texture.

This serum is well-suited for those looking for a light, hydrating eye serum, but if you’re after significant correction for fine lines, puffiness, or dark circles, it might not be potent enough. Overall, it’s a pleasant addition to a routine for extra hydration, though the results may be too minimal for those expecting a more transformative effect.",179,2025-04-15 17:39:20

The lightweight formula absorbs quickly and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.

customer_review-R2JKY2RQ0S4F1E,B0CTC25796,Finicky but miraculous,4.0,"January 29, 2025",Tanni Ahmed,1,"This stuff WORKS. However, it needs to be prepared and applied correctly or it’s useless. You HAVE to start with a completely clean, untouched base (if I use any kind of eye cream or moisturizer underneath it, it doesn’t do a darn thing.) But they do warn you about that in the instructions so it’s to be expected. I cleanse, then use a gentle toner (it MUST be oil-free) under the eyes and let it dry completely before applying.

You then have to apply JUST the right amount (trial and error, but I’ve found that about a pea size dot is enough for both eyes), and start by gently swiping on the area and THEN patting. When I start out by just patting, it doesn’t work as well. And do NOT get it right underneath the eyes.. it will be crepe-city. This is designed to reduce bags, not fine lines. When I get it too close under my eyes where I have lines I'm horrified. It also definitely feels weird and tight but that’s to be expected.

After applying, I’ve found that putting ANY kind of liquid/cream product on top of it (concealer, foundation, moisturizer) completely negates its effects. They say in the instructions that any kind of oil breaks down the tightening qualities and it’s true. So if you want to put makeup on top, it’s best to use some sort of lightweight powder. It does have a tint to it so I haven’t found the need for concealer when I’m wearing it.

It definitely is fussy and finicky BUT it works so well I don’t mind. If you read the instructions they are very straightforward about how particular you have to be to get good results, so it’s not like they’re trying to trick you. Now that I’ve practiced with it a bunch, I’ll never be without it. I won’t use it every day because I do like to put eye cream on in the morning and can’t do that with this, so I save it for special occasions or extra-puffy days. It’s expensive but worth it for those days.",52,2025-04-15 17:39:21

I don't think I have been using this long enough to speak to the effects of the retinal on fine lines, but what I do like is that it is a nice retinal eye cream that doesn't irritate my dry, sensitive eyes. I have to be very careful what I put near my eyes as many products cause eye irritation. Of course, I don't slather it all over my eyelids but I am able to use it under my eyes before bed and I haven't really had any issues with sensitivity. I will say that I also use tretinoin on my face at night (avoiding the eye area) and my skin does ok with retinoids so I would be careful if you are sensitive to retionoids as the eye area is quite delicate.",0,2025-04-15 17:39:21

After about a week of use I have had to stop because I’ve developed a retinol burn under one of my eyes. If you are not familiar with Retinol/Retinal products, it is recommended to start slow with only 2–3x per week use until your skin builds up a tolerance. I (ignorantly) assumed because I already regularly use Tretinoin that my skin would tolerate this well and not have an issue. Can’t speak to the long term efficacy of the product yet but I will try again with more caution once my eye heals. If you are considering this product, BE PATIENT! Start with only a few applications per week and preferably apply at night as your skin might also be more sensitive to UV damage when using. On nights when not using, be sure to moisturize and help support your skin barrier while you’re still adjusting.",18,2025-04-15 17:39:29

I used to use an eye cream that had a bit of shimmer that reflected the light to 'hide' my dark circles not help them. I don't feel this eye serum has helped too much with my dark circles but there is some change. The overall texture of around my eyes is much softer, the wrinkles that I have are less noticeable.

Secondly, because my previous eye cream was was a heavier consistency, I used too much with the first application. One pump for both eyes is enough for me. The eye serum is light weight with little to no fragrance. I dab between my 2 ring fingers and apply under my eyes and on my eye lids in a light swiping and tapping motion.

Lastly, there was no irritational from this eye serum. It has been gentle on my skin and very complimentary to another K-Beauty brands products that I use. I will continue using this product for the foreseeable future.",198,2025-04-15 17:39:32

I noticed my under eye area started getting dry crepe/wrinkly and hoped this would help! My under eyes are so incredibly smooth now - I use morning and night - I tap a bit of water first then the product. I let fully dry in the morning then use a sunscreen color corrector over top. I have used different concealers all with the same smooth result. I don't use powders under my eyes - don't need to. I don't go crazy with the amount but don't skimp either.

customer_review-R3VUR108MSZRC4,B0CTC25796,"I’ve been let down by so many eye creams, but this one finally impressed me.",5.0,"October 10, 2024",Gina Arnone,1,"Finding an eye serum that delivers real results without costing a fortune has been a journey, but Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum has really impressed me. I was starting to think only high-end creams or simple options like CeraVe could do the job, but this serum handles everything I need—puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines—while remaining budget-friendly.

The serum has a lightweight consistency that absorbs quickly, and I really appreciate how it doesn’t leave a sticky residue. It feels refreshing around the eyes and layers beautifully under makeup without causing any pilling, which is a must for me. I love the combination of ginseng and retinal, which work together to hydrate and smooth the skin. Ginseng provides that deep hydration and elasticity boost, while retinal gently improves texture and firmness. It’s great that the retinal is in liposome form, so it’s more stable and less likely to cause irritation compared to traditional retinol.

What’s also great about this product is the size. A lot of eye creams come in tiny amounts that you burn through in no time, but this one gives you a more generous portion. I also like that it’s gentle enough for daily use and even works well for those with sensitive skin, like me. Over time, I’ve noticed a real improvement in how smooth and bright my under-eye area looks, which I haven’t found with many other products.

Final Thoughts
If you’re looking for an affordable yet effective eye serum, the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum is worth trying. It handles puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines without breaking the bank, and the combination of ginseng and retinal is great for long-term skin health. I’m really happy with the results so far, and it’s refreshing to find an eye product that actually works for me.",91,2025-04-15 17:39:37

I too, received this with a broken pump. They need to rethink the bottle/tube design. Totally bummed about that, but I don’t feel like waiting to have another sent or waiting on ordering the comparable item that was in the running. I’ve only been using it for a few days and have had no adverse reaction/sensitivity, so far. I did it one off and one on for the first 2 times and then switched to using it every night. It’s a little inconvenient to remove the cap and squeeze to dispense, as it is not designed to do that. This seems to be a good starter retinol, so I’ll try it and see how it does. I don’t find it to be greasy or to have any unpleasant or heavy fragrance. Now, time will tell..",2,2025-04-15 17:39:37

I’m always hesitant to use eye creams because I hadn’t found one that actually worked. Until I decided to take a gamble and try this one, which I saw talked about on TikTok…I am so happy with my purchase!
I am already very pleased with the results and I have not even been good at staying on a consistent schedule using it!
I use it at night before going to bed. I squeeze like a half pea size for each eye. A little goes along way because it is so smooth, easy to apply, and absorbs amazingly. Because it does have some retinal in it, and my under eyes can be sensitive to retinal mixing with other ingredients, I find the best time for me to apply is at night. I wake up to such moisturized and even looking skin under my eyes in the morning. Ugh, I’m in love. Like I said, it makes me like my face better haha I also like that it doesn’t have a scent - or at least not one that I can smell.
The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that my pump doesn’t work and hasn’t since I got it. I have to unscrew the cap to get the product out.",162,2025-04-15 17:39:40

I use one pump on my whole face morning and night

I don't know if it's the eye cream or the whole skincare revamp, but I've gotten a ridiculous amount of compliments on my skin. Two separate friends I hadn't seen in a couple of months asked me to send them instructions to my regimen! I chalk it up to three things: this eye cream for sure; Naked and Thriving's Renew night serum; and finishing my skincare routine with pure squalane oil to lock in the treatments.

My under eyes are ALWAYS dark like no matter how much sleep I get. These brightened me up better than anything I’ve ever used and it worked so fast too. I notified a difference the next day.

My under eyes feel super soft and hydrated and the best part is the cream is lightweight and rubs in nicely so it doesn’t feel like you have heavy goop under your eyes. Sometimes other under eye cream can feel heavy.

I have semi-sensitive skin too and this stuff was perfectly fine for me. By sensitive, I mean I usually get one or two random pimples if I try anything new and my skin doesn’t like it.

customer_review-R2EWR87J1N9LJD,B09DLFCB69,My skin adores BOJ,5.0,"September 3, 2024",Kathryn Magendie,1,"I had the trial size of this Glow Deep Serum. The mini size set contained this Glow Deep, another glow serum that has other types of antioxidants, snail mucin mixed with ginseng, and a green tea calming serum. Out of that set I reordered the two glow serums and likely will reorder the green tea. I use CoxRx snail mucin, which is amazing, so I likely won't order the ginseng and snail mucin though it is a great serum as well.

Beauty of Joseon is so calming and so gorgeous on my rosacea prone skin - I have Type 1, which means my cheeks and sometimes my nose will turn red or have some flushing. If my skin barrier is messed up, there could be stinging as well when I use some skincare products.

But BOJ calms my skin and this Glow Deep gives my skin a nice glow without being too shiny and is super great for hydration.

Alpha arbutin, an antioxidant that is basically Hydroquinone, comes from the bearberry plant, and works as a skin brightener and for post-inflammatory pigmentation, and helps with hydration.

It just makes my skin look and feel amazing. I am moving towards having most of my skincare come from BOJ, CosRx, and maybe some Gangnam Glow. These seem to be the ones that make my skin feel hydrated, calm my rosacea redness, give me a glow, help with mature skin, and are inexpensive. And CoxRx and BOJ are not fragranced, though a little essential oil fragrance doesn't seem to bother my skin too bad. But the perfumes will and these brands are not perfumed.",74,2025-04-15 17:40:16

I did like the hydration but I didn’t notice any real improvement in my dark spots or discoloration.

The texture is lightweight, absorbs well, and feels really soothing, especially on days when my skin feels a bit dry or irritated. I also appreciate that it’s fragrance-free, which is great for sensitive skin like mine.

That said, I was hoping to see more visible results with fading acne scars or evening out my skin tone. Unfortunately, I didn’t notice much difference in that area.

Overall, I’d give it 3 stars — great for hydration and a nice addition to your routine if you’re just looking for moisture and a calming serum, but it didn’t deliver on the brightening claims for me.",0,2025-04-15 17:40:19

customer_review-R161LBKEHFCJ0Y,B09DLFCB69,"""Not bad.. But not good."" - Jisoo",3.0,"October 14, 2024",Just here,1,"Initially bought for my mom because she wanted to attain glowy skin. However, there is MINIMAL stinging for those who have sensitive skin or broken skin. Thus she passed it on to me, now I will say it worked a little bit on my OVERLY QUENCHED dry skin. But the serum did put my rosacea and textured skin in the spotlight so keep that in mind for those of you with similar features.

The only issue is... it's not really a moisturizing agent nor do I feel like it's nurturing to the skin. It works like a clear shiny top coat over your face. It has the same consistency as any ampoule and I do like how it doesn't have that oily after effect. Yet sometimes I do feel like my pores are being blocked due to the ""full coverage"" properties. Leading me to use it as a last step of my skincare or for my really dry patches.

In conclusion, get this product if you only want to achieve ""surface"" level look for dewy skin. Such as photoshoots or natural makeup without any oily issues.

DON'T GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LONG TERM VITALIZING/NOURISHING BENEFITS! You're better off applying a ""moisturizing"" sheet mask from Korea.",12,2025-04-15 17:40:28

Brown,1,"I have sensitive skin so it’s hard to find serums and other facial products that don’t cause me irritation. This serum is really good for my skin and gives me great moisturizer and no oiliness or residue. It also blends well with the other products I use on a daily basis (Tretinoin, Azelaic Acid, moisturizer, eye cremes).

A little also goes a long way with this product as you do not need a lot of it to spread on your entire face. It even pairs well with light sunscreens.

Over time I have seen improvement with dark spots on my face (but I would not attribute those improvements to this product alone as I mentioned above I do use other products).

First right of the bat it improved the texture of my skin leaving it very soft.
I had no irritations which is great.
I tend to get these “allergic reaction pimples” and spent a lot of money on truly beauty for example just to have itchy pimple all over my forehead and other areas. This was the reason why I looked into something else, and more affordable too.
This fit the bill and worth a try.
And I am so glad I did.
No itchy pimples and after a week I can’t totally tell that it’s working.
I can see that my skin is brighter.

It is not worth it for the price I bought at around 18? dollars or so. There are so many other better korean products for brightening skin at a better value. Also, the consistency is pretty thick and sticky which I didn't expect but will say wasn't too unpleasant. Also, it seems like it is pretty gentle/non irritating, but also be aware that if you do use the product, don't use it for too long because it is risky to use alpha arbutin for too long/more than 6 months",0,2025-04-15 17:40:40

My favorite things about it is that it doesn’t have any scent, it’s very lightweight, and gentle on my sensitive skin. For reference, I have eczema and this gives my face that dewy look I never thought I could achieve. Best of all, it’s the only product I’m currently using on my face. I tend to have breakouts if I use multiple skincare products so it’s important to have one thing that targets multiple issues. I simply wash my face with warm water, pat dry, and apply this serum.

I thought it would smell like gingseng but no. The serum is the consistency of a thin gel. I press two drops into my skin. It absorbs quickly. As for results, I have been really impressed by how this serum evens out skin tone with use. Any pigmentation I had from sun exposure is really improved.

customer_review-R1XLLQMFTE6L1F,B0BBQZVQS3,"If you have sensitive skin, you need this!",5.0,"March 20, 2025",Amber K.,1,"Last week, I somehow messed my skin up. I didn’t use any new products on my skin, but I did re-introduce two products to my routine. I’m not sure if it was too much change too quickly or if one of those products didn’t mesh well with the rest of my routine. Whatever it was, my skin barrier was trashed. Like very painful burning, skin flaking off, super red. Miserable. After two days of dealing with that, I remembered seeing this product and decided to give it a try. I put this on clean skin, then topped with snail mucin essence, then moisturizer the night it arrived. I did the same routine in the next morning. By 24 hrs after the first application, my skin was 80% better. I could not be happier. I was seriously in so much pain. As someone with very sensitive skin, I will be keeping this on hand at all times. Worth every penny.",3,2025-04-15 17:42:54

Pros:

Visible Results: After just a few days of use, I noticed my skin looked brighter and more even. By the end of week two, the fine lines around my eyes had visibly softened, and my complexion was much smoother.

Lightweight and Absorbent: The serum has a light, silky texture that absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling greasy or sticky. I can easily layer it under my moisturizer and sunscreen in the morning.

Gentle on the Skin: I have sensitive skin, and this serum didn’t cause any irritation or redness, which is a big plus for me. It feels calming and refreshing each time I apply it.

Great Ingredients: I love that Jeoson Serum contains a blend of vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and peptides, which are known to promote collagen production and hydrate the skin. It’s clear that a lot of thought went into the formulation.",0,2025-04-15 17:42:54
customer_review-R152RE2WU69JU6,B0BBQZVQS3,Soothed and smoothed,5.0,"January 30, 2025",A,1,"I have had some redness and tiny bumps on my cheeks for as long as I can remember, even back to childhood and before puberty. This calming serum reduced the redness and smoothed my skin down in DAYS and my cheeks are literally softer than they were when I was a child. The condition of my skin was never a big deal to start with, but the difference to me is huge and I feel so happy when I feel how soft my face is now.

The serum feels light and absorbs quickly, and a little goes a long way. The tip of the dropper is also shaped in a way that holds the serum better than some others I've had, so it's very hard for it to drip by accident and go to waste. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to get the serum at the bottom using the dropper once the bottle is almost empty, but I turned it over and let drip into a new bottle.",9,2025-04-15 17:42:54

customer_review-R20LLKQ0Z4F97P,B0BBQZVQS3,WORKS FOR MY HIGHLY SENSITIVE SKIN!!!,5.0,"August 24, 2023",Rebecca M.,1,"Let me start by saying I never leave reviews!!! I have always had sensitive skin. I have battled eczema and rashes that no doctor could diagnose. About 6 years ago I constantly had the rash in the last photo on and off. It burned and itched and felt like I had hundreds of blisters on my face. My dermatologist prescribed me steroids and steroid creams (not great because it thins your skin out over time). I’ve done extensive allergy tests with no answer to what causes this.

I just turned 32 and desperately want to be a skincare girly. But the only things I could use on my face were okay sensitive face wash and Aveeno baby lavender lotion! Anything else has caused me to have a reaction. Even makeup wipes would send my skin into a frenzy and I’d end up at the doctors office.

I’ve been doing research and wanted to use things that fellow sensitive skin people have tried with success. Along with reading extensive reviews. I decided to try this product and I am happy to say that I will be purchasing again! There is no stinging, burning or itching of any kind! I mean JUST LOOK AT MY GLOWING SKIN!",914,2025-04-15 17:42:58

This is a very lightweight serum. I would almost call it an essence. I use this as one of my first steps after cleansing and toning.

I have Type 1 Rosacea, and this doesn't irritate my skin, and it does feel calming to my skin. Does it take away redness?--it may somewhat, but it does help to calm it before I go on to the rest of my skincare.

This along with their glow serums give my face that nice healthy glow. Not the greasy or oily 'faux glow' that some serums give, but a real healthy glow.

I also like their ginseng cleansing oil and their ginseng essence water.

True to its name, this serum really does “calm” the skin. It might be a bit pricey, but the quality is so worth it!! Forever a staple in my day and night time routines.

UPDATE:
When I ran out of this serum, I tried a couple of others including Skin1004 and PURITO, which I must report neither got the job done for me the way this Beauty of Joseon Calming serum did. I have combination skin that varies from resilient to sensitive depending on the seasons, but no matter what, is always red. I use half a dropper full of this BoJ Calming serum and I’m good all day.

customer_review-R1POTHYILL0QV5,B0CVKM5MMH,"A Hydrating, Brightening Marvel for Your Skin",5.0,"February 15, 2025",Forough,1,"I recently tried the Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream, and it has quickly become one of my favorite moisturizers. This cream beautifully blends traditional Korean herbal ingredients (Hanbang) with modern skincare benefits, making it an excellent choice for hydration, brightening, and overall skin health.

Texture & Absorption

The cream has a silky, lightweight gel-cream texture that feels luxurious on the skin. Despite being deeply hydrating, it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy. It leaves a healthy, dewy glow without making the skin look overly shiny, making it perfect for both day and night use.

Hydration & Moisture

With key ingredients like rice bran water, ginseng root extract, and niacinamide, this cream provides long-lasting hydration while brightening the skin and improving elasticity. My skin feels plump, soft, and well-nourished after using it, and it helps with dry patches without clogging pores.

Skin Benefits

✔ Brightens and evens out skin tone
✔ Provides deep hydration without heaviness
✔ Soothes and strengthens the skin barrier
✔ Works well under makeup for a smooth base

Scent & Packaging

The cream has a light, herbal-floral scent that fades quickly after application. The packaging is minimalist and elegant, but the jar can appear less full due to the air-sealed packaging process.

Best For:

✔ Normal to dry skin looking for deep hydration
✔ Combination skin needing moisture without heaviness
✔ Sensitive skin, thanks to its calming and non-irritating formula

Final Verdict

The Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream is an amazing all-in-one moisturizer that hydrates, brightens, and soothes the skin. If you’re looking for a luxurious, effective, and affordable moisturizer, this is definitely worth trying!",25,2025-04-15 17:44:51

5.0 for BOJ being a gorgeous brand
5.0 for unscented
3.0 for sticky quality

I adore Beauty of Joseon, and have quite a few of their products that I use and those products work so well with my skin. I usually have nothing negative to say about BOJ. But just as with any skincare, you usually won't absolutely always love every single product. And that's the case with this Dynasty cream.

On the plus side, it's so silky soft. It a joy to apply to my face. It has a serum quality to it. While it feels lightweight and serum or gel-like mixed with cream, it is 'heavier' than it feels/appears.

But, something in this formula does become somewhat sticky. I am used to some of my serums being sticky and I don't mind so much since I'll be putting something on top of them to seal those in. But this is often the last step other than my SPF if I am leaving the house, so it will be atop my skin.

I am so on the fence about this cream! I love it and love that it's unscented and love the serum silky feel, but that stickiness is a bit off-putting.

I pat it on and press and when I press I really notice that sticky quality. But it does finally absorb and that's great! Just have to give it time.

One big plus for me, now that I think about it, is that when I put my thick mineral SPF over this moisturizer, my sunscreen goes on a little easier.

I am not sure if I would order this again. I have reordered many BOJ products - their glow serums, their ginseng essence, their ginseng oil cleanser to name a few, but I am going to see what other moisturizers they offer or if none maybe checkout something from CosRx or another brand. But, since I am such a fan of their beautiful products, I may just order it again anyway!",43,2025-04-15 17:44:57

I've generally been happy and satisfied with my whole routine for awhile now... except for my moisturizer. Maybe I'm just picky, but I've tried every brand you can think of and never really wanted to settle on any of them. Everything from cheap drugstore moisturizers, to viral TikTok brands, to overly-priced luxury products--all of which just 'did the job' at best. However, I've been a huge fan of this brand's other products for a long time now so I figured I should finally give their moisturizer a try!

Safe to say that I love love love it! Between being a full-time college student and working a full-time job, there's been a couple days lately where I didn't do any skincare at ALL with how busy I've been. Yet this moisturizer has kept my skin feeling great despite DAYS without washing my face (which I know definitely isn't ideal...I'm trying my best, I swear haha).

A lot of people dislike the texture, saying it's a little sticky. But I've had no problems with it. In fact, I really feel like if you're following through with a proper skincare routine and ensuring that you're not using any products that shouldn't be used together, then you shouldn't have any issue with it.

I genuinely have no complaints. I'm confident in saying that this is the best all-around moisturizer I've EVER used--and I think it's going to be a long time before I find anything that can beat this.",42,2025-04-15 17:45:05

I use their plum cleanser, alpha arbutin serum, gentle makeup remover, and their dynasty moisturizer. Before, I was using a subscription box called Curology and after a while I stopped because it wasn't within my financial means to keep paying for the subscription. I was worried I wouldn't find a good replacement of products that provided me with the current clear, smooth, and healthy skin I maintained while on Curology. But let me tell you that all these products from BOJ have definitely aided in transforming my skin in a good way! I am definitely going to buy more from BOJ because I know that using these products continually have helped in giving me better skin. I only have hormonal breakouts now due to my time of the month but other than that I'm acne free with these products and they're gentle enough that they don't irritate my eczema. My hyperpigmentation marks are also fading. I feel like with continued use of these products I am closer to achieving the infamous Korean glass skin. Their moisturizer in particular is very hydrating and melts in your skin. Perfect for night time use or in the winter months. Sometimes my skin can be pretty flakey when I use retinoids, so the dynasty cream really helps me to retain moisture.",20,2025-04-15 17:45:12

customer_review-RESUJ5QCCX53V,B0CVKM5MMH,I think my skin burn by this product,4.0,"June 28, 2023",Kai Kiu,1,"I'm a skincare beginner with combination skin. I've heard many positive comments about this product, so I decided to give it a try. Initially, I didn't have high expectations and applied it after my serum. However, within the first few minutes, it caused a burning or minty sensation on the edges of my face, like my jaw and near my ears. My mom also tried it, and her skin burned quite badly, but like mine, it stopped after a few minutes and left a minty sensation in the air around our faces. I'm not sure if this is the intended effect of a moisturizer, but I personally don't like it. Despite that, I thought I would be okay and give my skin some time to adapt. The product also became somewhat sticky, but I can tolerate that. On the positive side, I do like how it stays on my face throughout the day and night, giving my skin a glowing appearance. However, I dislike the recurring burning sensation every time I apply it, even though it's not painful. Ultimately, the only aspect I don't like about it is that I believe the ingredients are not suitable for both me and my mom ( my mom has oily skin.) However, I'm uncertain whether the moisturizer was mixed with other products that caused this effect or if it's an issue with my skin. The cleanser, toner, and serum I use are all from Beauty of Joseon because I believed their vegan ingredients would be suitable for my skin. The cleanser is called ""Green Plum Refreshing,"" the toner is ""Green Plum Refreshing AHA+BHA,"" and the serum is ""Calming Green Tea+Panthenol."" This moisturizer is also from the same brand.

customer_review-R2REYPGWIXAOKM,B0CVKM5MMH,Great for Sensitive Skin!!!,5.0,"July 19, 2023",White Rabbit Reviews,1,"If any of you have read my previous skincare reviews, you know how sensitive my skin is. Redness, itchiness, attractive eczema blotches from gentle products like Eucerin and Cerave even! I sometimes feel like my skin is an entity of its own- a very irritable, temperamental beast attached to my underlying organs.

In comes Beauty of Joseon Dynasty Cream-- I saw it in a youtube video from someone with very sensitive skin and decided to give it a try without high hopes at all. How could this work on my skin, if Eucerin ""approved for sensitive skin by dermatologists"" causes me to look like I got a bad sunburn?

I patch tested this first and noticed no redness or blotchiness or itching, so decided to slather it on my entire face the next day, preparing to have to stay home for a week of damage control. Instead, I noticed my skin drank it up and became glowy, dewy, and moisturized! I tried it for a few weeks without any reaction!

This cream works WONDERS on my dry, sensitive skin! It is one of the two night creams that I reach for every night- this and the Cerave night cream (one of only 2 Cerave products that don't cause my skin to look like it was attacked by a feral beast).

I highly recommend this night cream for anyone who has rosacea, eczema, or inflamed skin that reacts to EVERYTHING! I think it is reasonably priced as well- I usually have to repurchase every couple months or so, which isn't terrible. I have to replace my Cerave night cream more often, which is only 5 dollars cheaper than this.

I will provide an update if my skin changes its mind, but for a few months now, it's been a dream come true for me!!!!",55,2025-04-15 17:45:15

customer_review-RSUM9C8YGANBZ,B08RLZ28QK,Hydration and Vitality with the Power of Ginseng,5.0,"March 14, 2025",Miguel,1,"The Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water is a fantastic choice for those looking for hydrated, balanced, and revitalized skin. Its formula features key ingredients such as 80% ginseng water, providing deep hydration, 2% niacinamide, which helps strengthen the skin barrier and minimize pores, and 0.5% BHA, perfect for gentle exfoliation without irritation.

This product works as a toner, essence, and lightweight moisturizer, making it versatile and suitable for both oily and dry skin. With regular use, the skin appears more radiant and healthy.

One thing to note is that while it provides good hydration, those with extremely dry skin might need an additional moisturizer. Overall, it’s a great K-Beauty essential worth trying!

Es un producto versátil que funciona tanto como tónico, esencia e hidratante ligero, adaptándose bien a diferentes tipos de piel, ya sea grasa o seca. Tras varias aplicaciones, se nota una piel más luminosa y saludable.

El único punto a considerar es que, aunque hidrata bien, quienes tienen piel extremadamente seca podrían necesitar un refuerzo con una crema más densa. En general, es un excelente producto de K-Beauty que vale la pena probar.",6,2025-04-15 17:45:48
customer_review-RJQ7JWYSLBZPM,B08RLZ28QK,It was great till it was not..,5.0,"September 3, 2024",Monica,1,"I really do not do reviews but in this case I feel like I have to, to warn people have sensitive skin to be careful if they want to try this skincare line. I ordered my first beauty of Joseon last year I got the ginseng toner, the cleanser and the serum that goes with it. Up on using the product I felt that my skin is healthy and glowing and clear then it have ever been. And to make it clear I have a hyper sensitive skin and on top of that I have eczema so my skin can flare up anytime if it wants to or if I use something that irritates it. Since I use the products for a year everything was doing fine everything was perfect I'm loving the product there's no problem with it my skin is loving it not until the beginning of this year all of a sudden my face broke out. My face started to itch I thought it was just itchy but when I look at it on the mirror I see some redness on my skin and some rash, so basically my face was flaring up but I did not blame it to the skincare that I was using because like I said a year prior everything was perfect so I thought it's just my skin doing its thing and it's going to go away. So I stopped using the skin care line until my face was fully healed so that was about June when my face finally healed from the flare-up that I had from the beginning of the this year. I didn't use the toner because I ran out, but I still have the oil based cleanser and I'm being using it on and off and my face is okay it didn't flare up it no allergic reaction or anything like that. decided to reorder the toner Plus the light vitamin C serum and got delivered yesterday, so I opened up the new bottle of toner and the vitamin C light serum and use it exactly at 9:40 p.m.. but when 3:00 a.m. came left corner of my lips was kind of itchy so I checked it out on the mirror and it was red and I was praying in my heart that it wasn't from the toner and the term that I used prior before going to work. But as the morning progress the T-Zone area on my face flared up now it have a full-blown allergic reaction it have this small type of rash and it's red and it's itchy. So I am sad to say I am discontinuing using the toner and serum. before knowing that the cause of my previous allergic reaction was this skin care line I reordered the snail serum as well because I was using that last year and I really like the results. Now I'm sad because not only did I feel like I wasted my money now I don't know what to do with this brand new products especially the snail serum that is going to be delivered tomorrow.
So in conclusion for all of the people who have sensitive skin and their skin can be easily irritated please be careful before buying this or any type of skin care. Just make myself clear I'm not saying the product is not good because like I said I love the product and it worked on me last year when i got it.",74,2025-04-15 17:45:48

They also have a ginseng/snail mucin mix that works so well for my rosacea redness. If I use CosRX centella asiatica toner, then this ginseng essence, and top it off with either CoxRX snail mucin or the BOJ ginseng/smail mucin, my skin is not only glowing with a healthy glow, but the redness is very much calmed down! That's all I have on my face as I write this and my skin feels wonderful. I will add some retinoid and/or moisturizer later.

Love it!
--------------------

This is my first try of Beauty of Joseon and I would definitely try other products from this brand. My skin loves K-beauty, and as well I often find some K-beauty brands are not as pricey. This one is reasonably priced and a little goes a long way so that makes the value better as well.

I love how you have to 'shake out' a bit of the essence so that it isn't wasted - not to much comes out at a time and you don't need much. A few shakes onto my palm and I pat and then press the essence onto my skin. Patting and pressing works better than trying to 'rub' it onto the skin.

I do a multi-step routine - since I work remotely, I have the time to take my time. I cleanse and immediately use a toner--though this is both essence and toner, right now I have a separate milky toner. I sometimes apply this essence right after toning or I'll wait 10-15 minutes. I wait another 15 minutes or more and then comes my vitamin c. Waiting between each product allows it time to absorb into my skin (at least this is what my research indicates). It also gives my skin time to settle down between products. I apply my serums and moisturizers, and SPF last when I'm leaving the house.

Essences are mostly water and that's what they are supposed to be so don't expect something thicker or emollient. Essences are made to go on early in your routine, after cleansing, whether you use them as a toner or just an added step after toning as I'm doing right now until my milky toner runs out and then I will use this as one step toning and essence and see how that goes.

I have rosacea-prone skin and there is zero irritation or redness, no burning or itchy feeling. My skin tolerates this essence very well. It leaves my skin looking bright and refreshed.

There is 2% Niacinamide included, which is a form of vitamin B and though it's a small amount, it's still a powerhouse ingredient.

Ginseng is known for its anti-aging qualities, inflammation reducing, and brightening for the skin.

I'm happy with my order.",102,2025-04-15 17:45:48

customer_review-R20A7Z5IJD6R1P,B08RLZ28QK,This product was all over my instagram..,3.0,"September 27, 2023",Sarah,1,"The Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water is a popular Korean skincare product that combines traditional herbal ingredients with modern skincare science. Here's a review of this essence water based on its performance and qualities:

Pros:

1. Hydration: This essence water is exceptionally hydrating, making it an excellent choice for those with dry or dehydrated skin. It provides a surge of moisture that leaves the skin feeling plump and refreshed.

2. Key Ingredient: Ginseng: Ginseng is a renowned traditional Korean skincare ingredient known for its anti-aging and skin-firming properties. This product contains a high concentration of ginseng extract, which can help improve skin texture and elasticity over time.

3. Lightweight Texture: The essence water has a lightweight and watery consistency that absorbs quickly into the skin. It's suitable for layering with other skincare products in your routine.

4. Brightening Effect:t This product contributes to a brighter complexion and helps even out skin tone. The ginseng extract is believed to enhance skin radiance.

5. Gentle and Suitable for Sensitive Skin: This essence water is formulated without parabens, artificial fragrances, or other potentially irritating ingredients. It's suitable for sensitive skin types and is dermatologist-tested.

6. Packaging: The product is packaged in a beautiful glass bottle that adds a touch of luxury to your skincare routine. The pump dispenser is convenient and hygienic.

Cons:

1. Scent: I find the scent of this product to be slightly herbal or medicinal, which could be a personal preference issue. However, the scent dissipates quickly upon application.

2. Price: Beauty of Joseon products are considered to be on the higher end of the Korean skincare spectrum. While the quality justifies the cost for many, it may not fit everyone's budget.

3. Not Ideal for Oily Skin: Due to its rich hydration properties, this essence water may feel heavy on oily or acne-prone skin. It's better suited for individuals with dry to normal skin types.

In conclusion, the Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water is a highly effective and hydrating skincare product, particularly well-suited for those with dry or dehydrated skin. Its star ingredient, ginseng, provides anti-aging and brightening benefits over time. The lightweight texture and gentle formula make it a popular choice among skincare enthusiasts, although the price may be a consideration for some. If you're looking to incorporate the benefits of ginseng into your skincare routine and prioritize hydration and luminosity, this essence water is worth considering, especially if you appreciate the luxurious packaging and Korean skincare traditions.",167,2025-04-15 17:45:48

My skin was uneven, pigmented and a little dry from too much sun. So based on the good reviews I thought I'd give this a try. After about two weeks of using this twice daily, I can't believe how bright and plump my skin looks and feels. You do have to get used to the earthy smell and the texture is sort of slippery and sits on your skin but once it dries it's weightless. I top it off with Jumiso All Day Vit brightening serum and started both at the same time so tbh I'm not sure if it's the toner, serum or combination. In any case it works. Note that it does not lighten your skin just evens out darkish areas so you can still see my freckles but for some reason my skin glows. :) It comes in a cool thick plastic bottle which makes you wonder why Asian packaging is so awesome yet affordable.",15,2025-04-15 17:45:57

It hydrates my skin really well in a dry desert climate, I have sensitive combination skin and this toner has calmed down inflammation when I flare up. I have noticed a reduction in sebum production, after consistent use, on my T-zone and it leaves my skin hydrated in the dry areas (there was a time my T-zone was super oily and my cheeks dry and scaly). My skin has become even and after using this toner it looks dewy and hydrated.

This last bottle I receive had a root scent to it which it didn't have a scent in the past. I was worried it had gone bad or that they changed the formulation. I verified it on the Beauty of Joseon website and it wasn't expired, so far it has work the same as usual.",22,2025-04-15 17:45:57

It feels nice in the skin but I broke out within days of using it . Not too much but more than I expected. I’ve rarely used ginseng products but I’m going to stick with it for a couple of months because the breakout only lasted for two days . Not sure if it’s my cycle or the product I’ll check back in a few months . It’s not moisturizing for me and I have oily skin. If I had an essence I would add a moisturizing essence on top . However I will say it absorbs quickly and controls sebum !!! My pores have seemed smaller I know you can’t shrink pores but these prevent my pores from expanding. It works for my neck and top part of my face wonderfully but not for my jawline where I get acne. It feels sticky at first but quickly goes away then my skin just feels refreshed.

Either way, my skin is clearing up and looking really good so I don’t intend to stop using this. The bottle is a good size and is sturdy. Very good quality.

**UPDATE** Been using this for months now and firstly, it’s not a toner! Haha whoops. But it’s actually working nicely still. I use pretty much only Beauty of Joseon now (cleanser, this essence, the hanbang serum, and gel moisturizer) and my skin is super clear! I had great pores before but I really do feel like I look healthier and that’s weird since my diet needs changing lol.

The whole point of essence is to prep your face for the moisture and goo to come, and let me tell you that just TWO drops of this stuff will give your face a sticky feeling that bodes well for gripping the heck out of whatever might come next (it’s serum).

There’s no smell and it doesn’t burn, however I haven’t tried drinking it or putting it in my eyes, as this is not part of any skincare routine as far as I know. My skin has had no negative reaction to it whatsoever.

Using this at the appropriate time in my routine and applying with my fingers (while admittedly a bit messy) has made a huge difference. I can see and feel a difference in my skin, I really feel this product has seriously done some work for skin in just a few weeks of consistency.

UPDATE: after a few weeks of using this essence I can see why some people recommend this brand. The essence is lightweight but when applied on the skin it leaves the skin feeling soft without any sticky residue. I added the essence to my daylight routine in combination with a Vit C serum, a moisturizer of this same brand and a sunblock.

The ginseng water doesn't really have a scent to it? It does smell a little like musty rain if anything. I'm not too big of a fan of the scent. Applying the water does make my acne a little inflamed for 30 minutes so on days where my acne is bad, I don't apply it.

My pores are usually huge and open and everything and anything gets in them or is coming out of them. It’s insane, every time I wash my face there are a million things with sebum that I can pop or remove. With the help of this product and some other beauty of Joseon items, I notice it closes up my pores more, so less gets in or something. I’m not a dermatologist I just know there is less to pop, less inflamed oil-filled pores after using this product. I like how it’s not sticky or heavy on my skin. I put on quite a few layers of products and I no longer get that face pulling stuff. I’m also using the balm cleanser and a lactic acid at night.",22,2025-04-15 17:46:12

I did a patch test and found it did legitimately nothing, but (unfortunately) I stuck with it because I thought it would get better the more I used it.

Instead, it formed closed comedones mainly around my temples, cheeks, and eye area. These eventually developed into deep, painful breakouts that would last weeks. I have acne-prone, oily skin so that might be why, but I've never experienced a reaction like this from a skincare product.

On top of that it never hydrated, soothed, or improved my skin barrier in any way. In fact it left an uncomfortable, tacky residue on my skin so it didn't even feel good to apply. Sad to say but be wary of this product if you have sensitive skin. 😔",0,2025-04-15 17:46:14

After washing my face and drying it I put some water on my tightly held fingers and apply it on one side of my face, repeat it to the other side of my face. My skin feels instantly moisturized.

I still put some cream (Weleda). Water alone wouldn't be enough because I'm pass middle age, but cream
gets absorbed very well by the skin prepared by Ginseng water. I get complements on my skin.

customer_review-R1LCTEVXGSJQ10,B0BJPKX14D,Love it!,5.0,"December 29, 2024",sana shaikh,1,"The Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Refreshing Pore Mask is an absolute gem for anyone looking to detoxify their skin while maintaining hydration. As someone with oily skin, I’m always on the lookout for products that purify without leaving my skin feeling stripped, and this mask delivers perfectly.

The formula is enriched with red bean extract, which is known for its antioxidant properties. The texture is smooth with a gentle, grainy consistency—enough to provide light exfoliation but not so rough that it irritates. Applying it feels like a mini spa experience; the mask spreads easily and has a natural, earthy scent that’s soothing without being overwhelming.

I left it on for about 10 minutes, during which it didn’t dry out uncomfortably like some clay masks do. Washing it off was easy, and I loved the slight scrubbing effect as I rinsed. The results were immediate—my skin felt clean, refreshed, and soft, with noticeably minimized pores around my T-zone.

What I appreciate most is that, unlike many pore-focused masks, it didn’t leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my face felt balanced, as if it had just hit the reset button.

This mask is perfect for weekly use, especially if you’re dealing with congestion or dullness. The Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Mask combines tradition with modern skincare needs beautifully, making it a must-try for anyone seeking gentle yet effective pore care.",47,2025-04-15 17:46:54

It’s very refreshing, I like to use this one in the morning and then the rice mask at night by the same brand. They make my skin feel fresh and smooth, and they don’t cause irritation instead it calms some of the redness I usually experience. There’s a notable difference in my skin when I use this regularly and when I don’t use it for a few days in terms of lasting hydration and skin elasticity.

It has a strong scent despite having no added fragrance. I had it on for about 15 minutes and while it was on it felt kind of tingly and weird but not unpleasant. It was a bit hard to wipe off, but once I did it left my skin feeling very clean and soft but also very dry. Then the prickly feeling started, which lasted for a while and was very unpleasant. I have sensitive skin but I'm not sure how to pinpoint which ingredient(s) would irritate my skin.

The container is a decent size and comes with a little plastic spatula, although I used my own silicone tool to apply it. Overall I would say it's probably a great product for people with super oily skin, but I think it's just not for me.",20,2025-04-15 17:46:55

customer_review-RSLV7U2ZP1QPZ,B0BJPKX14D,"Okay, This is Pretty Amazing…",5.0,"December 7, 2024",Linné,1,"Okay, I have to admit - this red bean pore mask was pretty amazing! While I can’t say it did wonders on my blackheads and/or pores (since I haven’t used it long enough yet to comment on), what did work was on an angry pimple I had smack dab on the forehead. I have combo skin and endless blackheads but rarely do I get pimples. If I happen to get a blemish, it’ll get zapped with Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Spot Gel before it becomes anything larger. This particular pimple I had was an angry one which given a bit of time became pus-filled. Since I had this mask in my arsenal, I decided to give it a shot. It definitely brought the white pus to the surface which left me with no choice but to drain it - all this while instantly brightening up my face and leaving me with a gorgeous glow. This mask and that of Beauty of Joseon’s honey oatmeal version worked beautifully in conjunction on my skin and with solving this pimple. I used the latter a day later to calm down the inflammation and in no time, the dark spot left from the pimple was dissolved. Sure, there’s still a remnant left of a dark spot but I’ll continue busting the issue with these two masks and I have high hopes it’ll take care of the minor mark. This only took me two days to resolve - red bean pore mask on one day and the honey oatmeal mask on another. That’s quite the track record and I wasn’t expecting any promising results at all!

If your skin is oily due to make up, this is not the product for you. I use this to minimize my pores.. it works, wonders it leaves my skin, soft and moisturized without the oily shine that I normally have. It lasts for an extremely long amount of time for the size of the container. I am happy with the product. I have been using their products for a while. I am 38 years old and I have always had extremely oily skin. I didn’t buy this because of TikTok. I bought this because I was looking for something that would help remove oil.
So I’ve read on some of the reviews people say that it smells bad. I think it smells like bean paste. It doesn’t really have a clay texture because I also have clay masks, and I can feel the difference at the texture. For me, it does not sting my face unlike when I do my clay mask with apple cider vinegar. I can feel that one tightening my face. This one is a soothing oil remover that I sometimes forget I have on my face. I can walk around my whole house with it on and wash it off after 10 minutes sometimes I leave it on longer cause like I said I forget that it’s there.
I would recommend this every single time. I have my I would never recommend this for someone who has dry skin or normal skin cause this would probably dry you out so much that it would cause you to get more acne.
So I will emphasize to definitely know your skin type.",21,2025-04-15 17:47:01

I took a chance on this one - I was skeptical of the beads - but they were extremely soft and non-abrasive like the apricot scrubs, etc. The mask came with a spatula (smaller than imagined, but it’s the perfect size) most masks don’t come with one so that was bonus points already! It went on so smoothly & didn’t burn or irritate my skin. I left it on for 13 minutes & it seemed to work great, I might try 14 minutes next time. It washed off pretty easily, the beads were did come off into the sink but easily washed away. The best part…. It didn’t make my skin feel dry or tight once I washed it off! I got busy for about ten minutes after taking it off and my skin didn’t feel tight AT ALL.

Also, my biggest pores are in between my eyebrows but generally my t-zone. I’m not kidding when I say they were visibly smaller afterwards. Not completely “gone” obviously but significantly smaller. I felt so clean after. 10000000/10 I love this mask so far!",14,2025-04-15 17:47:07

I can’t speak to its exfoliating properties because I haven’t been using it long enough, but I can speak to the immediate effects. My skin is super sensitive. If you poke my skin, it will turn red and splotchy. A lot of clay/exfoliating masks will burn as soon as it touches my skin. I read another review saying this mask made their skin burn, so I was just expecting the same to happen for me, but it didn’t! No burning or tingling at all, and the grains are very very soft and not scratchy at all. I was expecting it to be a lot like the Glow Recipe hyaluronic clay mask, which burned the crap out of my face, so much so that my eyes watered. It is nothing like that mask, and it’s very soothing if anything. The grains/granules are soft but also hard enough to get the feeling of a physical exfoliator. It also doesn’t dry down and get itchy or cracky like a typical clay mask. It also smells like bananas to me lol I love my first experience and I can’t wait to use it more often and see results from the exfoliation!",79,2025-04-15 17:47:15

Also it does get ride of the redness because I like to use this once a week but after I use a pimple needle tool to get ride of my black and white beads and it leave a red mark after I am done using the tool. After I do that and then put on this red mask and leave it on for 13 minutes I can already see the red marks from the needle is gone already and it really gets into the pores.

application: comes with a spatula!! ALWAYS wash your face befure using a mask for maximum benefit and so it can do its job. NEVER use your hands to remove the product from the container. this causes cross contamination and puts bacteria in your mask 🫤 remember this with all products! easy to apply and easy to wash off. has a natural smell not a fragrance one.

I have dehydrated skin: dry and oily (not combo). Been searching for 20 ANOS for a moisturizer that is gel form, water based, light and highly moisturizing WITHOUT making me oily hours later.

AND FRAGRANCE FREE. Because lets face it, any company adding fragrance to their moisturizer has IMMEDIATELY lost all credibility....its their way to say ""we dont gaf what your skin absorbs""

I lightly dampen my skin after my serums and rub this silky, velvety, loveliness into my skin

Im also using Rx Retinol which makes you flaky at first. No matter how much of this stuff i use to contain the flakiness, IT STILL NEVER MAKES ME OILY!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

And yall, speaking of retinol - stop buying it

Studies prove OTC strength retinol is NOT effective. Manufacturers know this. Its all a scam. So call your regular doc right now and have them phone in an Rx for either the cream or gel retinol.

I promise it works amazingly.",92,2025-04-15 17:47:50

Before this is was using a pot face cream that cost like 34$ so double what this costs. Works best on damp/wet skin, noticed that it makes skin more sticky if you apply it dry. if you use too much you will notice, like i had to wash off the excess when i used it for the first time bc it just wouldnt absorb and left a film on my face. So far i think i like it, i will see if i get another - i have been using a lot of BoJ products and most of them work really well.

Pros: Very little needed, absorbs very fast. Results are very nice - skin feels super soft once it absorbs fully.

Cons: Causes kind of a tacky/sticky sensation on the face while its absorbing. Takes a couple of moments to absorb.",0,2025-04-15 17:47:50

Once it absorbs, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and plump. If you have really dry skin then it may not be enough on its own, but I find it works well when I layer it with a hydrating serum or toner.

I’m surprised at how much I like this. Im picky about my skin care.

LOVE IT. It leaves my skin so soft and my skin isn’t gushing oil to compensate.

It’s light, glides on smooth(doesn’t feel slimy), and layers well with my other products. I haven’t had any congestion issues or felt under moisturized (it’s in the 90’s-100’s all summer where I live and I regularly use acidic masks and chemical exfoliation and a 7% glycolic acid toner).

customer_review-R27GKMH92P2TL7,B0BJPJGG13,Not for me sadly 😭,2.0,"August 26, 2023",Chromebunny,1,"The packaging is so cute and the ingredients seem stellar, contains one pore clogging ingredient from what I’ve found but figured it would be alright.

Sadly didn’t agree with me, my skin feels drier than normal and fine lines are appearing in random spots overnight. I have combination (oily t zone) acne prone skin and thought one pore clogging ingredient (corn based ingredient) wouldn’t hurt too much. Unfortunately am breaking out in closed comedones in very odd spots I don’t normally get CC and my skin feels so tight and wrinkled in weird spots all of a sudden.

I could look past the breakouts if it was hydrating enough over my hyaluronic acid serum (torriden dive in serum) but the two definitely aren’t mixing (I am applying on wet skin etc torriden serum has been working wonderfully for me until this) and this doesn’t seem hydrating enough to sustain a skincare routine that demands extra hydration to accommodate for actives. The sudden appearance of random wrinkles, cracks, and tightness seemingly overnight kinda tipped me off to something being pretty wrong. Tried this without my HA serum as well wondering if maybe I was just mixing some stuff wrong somehow and still felt incredibly tight and dried for days as well as seeing new weird acne spots and wrinkles more fitting for a 40 year old rather than a 28 year old.

I wanted so badly to love this bc the packaging is cute and low pore clogging ingredients/a few beneficial ingredients but even as I type this the leftover red bean gel on my hands is making them feel SO dry and cracked, the hunt for a HG moisturizer continues 😭

My routine upon receiving this product:
AM
-light penny sized dollop face wash with skin food foaming rice cleanser (been using this for a couple years no issue brightens my complexion)
-cold water
-keep face fairly wet then apply torriden dive in serum (not touching toners rn as I’m slowly reintroducing things back into my routine)
-red bean gel a quarter sized dollop applied as my skin was still damp
PM
the same but double cleansing incorporating anua oil cleanser before everything (anua oil cleanser hasn’t ever broken me out before or dried me and has previously helped my closed comedones and blackheads)

Gave up cera ve face lotion bc it broke me out so badly for so long and tried this to hunt for something better but at least cera ve was hydrating. Hopefully this product works for somebody it’s so cute I’m jealous of y’all !

Two stars bc cute packaging, nice ingredients on first glance (make sure to google the ingredients and plug/copypaste them into a skincare ingredient checker just for your own knowledge and peace of mind as you explore your skincare journey and figure out what works for you and what doesn’t) and the texture is SO nice like cooling jelly. The tackiness upon drying makes foundation almost buttery to apply. Those were the only benefits for me.

customer_review-R1VXNR3CGF2HV,B0B45M89LX,Impressed After First Use!,5.0,"July 31, 2024",Angela R.,1,"I'm on a mission to seek out and try the best Korean skincare products that work for my skin, and so far this cleansing oil did wonders on my first use! I usually wait before writing reviews, so I can try out my purchases at least a few times. I felt compelled to share my experience after just one use!

I never knew a cleansing oil was necessary, and always wondered why influencers used so many products. Well it is a total game changer, especially if you combine it with a foaming cleanser afterwards. The deep pore foaming cleanser I used is from Anua, and it paired very well with this cleansing oil. I believe Joseon has something similar, but in a gel form. I will try that once I run out of Anua.

I first used the cleansing oil, and gently applied it to my face in circular motions. I focused on my T-zone for a few minutes to see if it made a difference in helping clear out my blackheads on my nose and forehead. I'm glad it doesn't leave an oily residue after rinsing. This cleansing oil melted off my make-up in a gentle manner and with no burning eyes. My skin didn't feel stripped either!

After cleansing oil, I followed with the Anua Heartleaf deep pore foaming cleanser. I grabbed my 10x mirror to see my nose, and holy cow my blackheads were pretty much gone! My pores looked very clean and I was so happy. If this is just one use so far, I cannot wait to see my results in the long run.

The smell of this product is of ginseng, and yes it may bother people, but it didn't bother me and it's a scent that doesn't last on your face. So, if your sensitive to scents, then this might not be for you.

Bottom Line: This cleansing oil will be my holy grail as long is it is offered!",39,2025-04-15 17:48:46

customer_review-R2A4PLEKVUYWLQ,B0B45M89LX,Not bad!,5.0,"October 11, 2024",Della,1,"Edit: Okay, so I have decided to edit after a few days of using this cleansing oil, and give it the other ⭐, because I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! Since writing my first review, I have discovered just how beautiful this cleansing oil really is. I wipe my face with warm water on a makeup wash cloth, put a couple of pumps of the oil in my hand, and just drip a few drops of warm water onto the oil in my hand, and immediately, it starts to turn like...creamy and white - not a frothy foam, but like milk in my hands. Then, I massage the creamy oil into my skin, and it doesn't really lather, so much as it seems to just become no longer oily. When I wipe it away, it leaves my skin just so...CLEAN and soft, but not feeling like it has stripped my face of all moisture like my benzoyl peroxide face wash does. It's bouncy and dewy and smooth. The other up side is that I don't have to wash my under eye areas separately with a gentle cleanser (I was using baby shampoo before buying this cleanser, and washing it first so that I didn't get benzoyl peroxide into my delicate under eye areas, which would have dried it out and caused worse fine lines). I can use this oil to gently wash my under eye area with my finger tips and to wash off my eye makeup if I'm wearing any, because it is so gentle and it adds moisture, instead of taking it away. My skin hasn't looked this good in decades - if EVER! I'm 41, and my skin looks better than it did at 31...or 21 for that matter, because for the first time in I can't remember when, I have ZERO blemishes, and - TMI, but: I'm in that point in my cycle when I'm usually having the worst breakouts, but not a single pimple or blackhead or bump of any kind. NOTHING has done so much for my skin as this oil has. Not retinol, not salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide not an expensive cream or serum - nothing!

I used to DREAD washing my face, because I had to take care not to get any under my eyes or on my neck, and had to thoroughly get all of it off when rinsing, etc, but this cleansing oil has turned my least favorite part of my skin care routine into my FAVORITE part! And I no longer dislike the smell; I now associate it with the lovely experience. I WILL be reordering! I'm even contemplating buying one to use in the shower! Seriously.

If you are interested in trying an oil-based face wash, but you're an oily or combination skin type, THIS is the one to try! It's now ESSENTIAL to my skin care routine. Did I say I LOVE it?!

Original review: So, first of all, I'm VERY impressed with the shipping. I ordered it after 11am, and it was on my porch by 4. Having two toddlers and no time to leave the house, that is just VERY convenient.

On to its quality: it feels very light and left my skin feeling clean and soft, and did not make me greasy. I did enjoy the spa-like feeling, too. It wiped clean with just warm water and a microfiber towel that's made for makeup removal.

However, my biggest issue is with the smell. It stinks. BUT, as a girl who grew up on the border of Appalachia and the Midwest, I recognize that smell: it's ginseng. While I don't usually desire scents in my skin care products, I would probably have approved of some modification of the smell of this particular product. That said, I'm going to continue using it BECAUSE of the ginseng and its antioxidant properties...but I'll probably follow it up with a toner that DOESN'T stink. lol

I'm an oily skin girl, and so far I don't think it's going to make things worse - especially since I'm still in the 6-8 week retinol purge, so not much CAN make it worse...ugh! AND my skin probably needs the addition of oil to prevent any dryness retinol may cause later on down the road.

I'm going to use this product up, and I'll decide when it gets close to empty whether or not I'm going to reorder. So far, so good. Excellent price for what you get too, so if you're looking for an effective oil cleanser that isn't just canola or coconut oil that will leave you greasy, this is the one.

Time will tell, and I'll be back - good or bad.",48,2025-04-15 17:48:46
customer_review-R2D2610MLY7CX0,B0B45M89LX,Does not work well in removing makeup and smell is unpleasant,3.0,"September 11, 2024",Amazon Customer,1,"I’ve used this cleansing oil for almost a year as I bought multiple bottles initially.
Pros: it works well as a gentle cleanser and does not dry out/strip your skin (as you would expect with a cleansing oil).
Affordable and lasts a very long time.

Cons: I mainly bought it to do the heavy lifting with removing my makeup and it did not do such a great job. I had to either cleanse with this oil twice to remove majority of the makeup followed by a different cleanser or micellar water or use more of the micellar water if using it once. Also if you use it heavily on your eyes, it would sting. For reference, I don’t use a lot of make up just tinted moisturizer, mascara and blush/bronzer.
It does have an added fragrance, but it does have a scent (maybe the natural scent of the ginseng oil) that kind of reminded me of gasoline, which I really disliked.

Personally for me, I won’t be purchasing it again.",13,2025-04-15 17:48:46
customer_review-R1TICWF41CEK80,B0B45M89LX,Beauty of Joseon is a lovely brand,5.0,"July 13, 2024",Kathryn Magendie,1,"Beauty of Joseon is fast becoming my most favorite K-Beauty (or any other skincare) Brand! They are getting a lot of attention lately but they've been around a while. Their products are gorgeous and so reasonably priced.

I have aging skin so cleansing oils work very well for me. I use them in the morning as the very first step in my skincare routine.

Apply a bit to dry skin and gently work it onto your face. Then add a bit of water and gently work that in. I rinse my face with tepid water - never hot! - about 10 times, and then give my face 4 or 5 splashes of cold water. I then tone, let my skin dry, pat and press on my vitamin c, let that absorb, and then the rest of my routine.

This cleanser goes on so smoothly and leaves my skin happy and non-irritated, but still clean. It does have a bit of a scent but it's not strong and it's not off-putting to me as it is to some - I rather like I t- and as well it quickly dissipates.

I am excited to try their balm and their gel cleanser for evenings when I want a deeper cleansing.

I've used other Beauty of Joseon products -like their ginseng essence - and love the brand. Reasonably priced too.

If you have dry aging skin, give cleansing oils a try. If you've worn sunscreen and/or makeup, you would want to double cleanse and maybe use a cleansing balm instead of this oil, but this is great on its own in the morning.",21,2025-04-15 17:48:46
customer_review-R1BT91E47DEJPL,B0B45M89LX,Great oil cleanser for removing face sunscreen and makeup,5.0,"April 1, 2025",Kathy,1,Great oil cleanser! I use this in the shower to remove my face sunscreen and makeup. The key to any oil cleanser is to work it in to dry skin first and THEN add water to emulsify it. I rinse it off completely and then follow up with a salicylic face wash. I use two pumps so it lasts a long time for me--I'd estimate about 4-5 months honestly :) I have normal-oily skin and I break out pretty easily if I introduce a product to my routine that doesn't agree with my skin. This has never caused any breakouts for me. I don't notice a strong fragrance either. Great value for the price! I've repurchased three times and will continue to repurchase.,0,2025-04-15 17:48:46

It’s oil — Duh! If you’re acne prone, use it for double cleansing with something else that treats acne (salicylic acid or benzoyl perioxide face wash). Wash with oil first; rinse; then use acne wash. I made the mistake of not double cleansing the first time I used this and, of course, developed a pimple within the day. This product has coconut oil and I’ve always broken out if I leave raw coconut oil on my skin.

The smell, to me, is that of Tea Tree Oil but I don’t see any in the ingredients. I do agree that soybean oil is a cheap byproduct and that, if there’s a heavy scent in the product, that perhaps they are trying to hide a rancid oil smell.

Otherwise, I actually very much liked this product prior to reading the nasty reviews!",10,2025-04-15 17:48:52

customer_review-R1XVQPXFHDFO4,B0B45M89LX,game changer for skin care!!,5.0,"July 21, 2023",Kristen Barnes,1,"I recently purchased the Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil and it has been a game-changer in my skincare routine. I've been on the hunt for a cleansing oil that effectively removes makeup, purifies my skin, and doesn't leave any oily residue - and I've finally found it!

The first thing I noticed was the packaging. The bottle is beautifully designed, with a nod to traditional Korean aesthetics that is in line with the brand's heritage. It's both practical and pretty on my bathroom shelf.

The oil itself is rich and luxurious, with a lovely subtle scent. The ginseng ingredient is what really caught my attention. Ginseng is known for its rejuvenating properties and antioxidants, and it's not often you find it in a cleansing oil. This product not only cleanses but also nurtures my skin, making it feel revitalized and refreshed.

Applying the oil is a treat in itself. It feels silky smooth on my skin, and it effortlessly dissolves makeup, dirt, and grime from the day. Unlike some other cleansing oils I've used, this one doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. Instead, my skin feels clean, supple, and incredibly hydrated.

What impressed me most, however, was the absence of a greasy residue. The Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil rinses off easily with warm water, leaving no oily film behind. My skin feels clean and soft, not slick or oily.

I’ve also noticed my skin looking brighter and more youthful since I started using this cleansing oil. The dullness I used to see has been replaced by a healthy glow, which I attribute to the nourishing ginseng and other beneficial ingredients in the formula.

Moreover, this product is wonderfully gentle. I have sensitive skin and I appreciate that this product didn't cause any irritation or breakouts. It's also worth noting that Beauty of Joseon prides itself on using high-quality, clean ingredients and this product is no exception.

In conclusion, the Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil is an innovative, high-quality product that delivers on its promises. It offers a thorough cleanse while also nurturing the skin with beneficial ingredients. It's a fantastic addition to any skincare routine and I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a gentle yet effective cleansing oil. It’s truly a luxurious skincare experience in a bottle!",157,2025-04-15 17:48:55

The ginseng scent took a little bit of time to get used to, even as a person who loves ginseng. Not bad, just not something typically encountered in skincare.

customer_review-R1IDMK7523MG4F,B0B45M89LX,Efficient for Double-Cleansing - but Heavy Oil Scent and Leaking Pump,3.0,"October 10, 2023",Jennifer,1,"I use this oil as the first step in my double-cleansing process. The oil itself has a slightly-heavy viscosity, which I prefer more than some of the other oil-cleansers I've tried with a thinner consistency. The thickness of the oil is perfect for lasting through my facial massages, which I gently do with a small facial cleansing mitt.

The oil transforms into a milky liquid once it comes into contact with water, and easily rinses away - but it does leave a slight film on my face after removal. I've no issue with this, however, as I follow-up my oil cleansing with another foaming or acidic cleanser.

My first concern with this oil is its scent. Given that the primary ingredient in the product is soybean oil, I'd expect to notice *some* aroma of the oil itself. But this product has one of the heavier ""oily"" scents I've smelled when using an oil cleanser (and I've used multiple types from different brands). While the scent isn't offensive, and doesn't cause me to have an allergic reaction? I'd prefer a more understated and elegant scent profile from this product - especially considering the elegantly minimalistic appearance of the bottle.

My second concern is the pump mechanism on the bottle. About a quarter of the way through the bottle's contents, my nozzle began to release oil from the base area where the pump depresses into the bottle. This happens each time I pump the nozzle. Not only does this waste product, it causes me to have to clean the exterior of the bottle after each use.

If not for the scent and the pumping issue, I'd include this oil in my regular rotation of daily skincare products - as it does a wonderful job of cleansing and providing ""slip"" for my face massages. But I won't repurchase this item as there are simply other products on the market where I don't experience these usability issues.",43,2025-04-15 17:48:58

While this completely does easily take off all my makeup and sunscreen, (without causing acne breakouts or milia, which I am prone to both), it does take a bit more product to dispense in order to have a sufficient amount for both my face and neck. I've tried other Korean cleansing oils (cheaper than this one even) and was able to successfully remove all dirt and products with simply one pump. Personally, this one takes 2 full pumps (which I would like to mention the pump speed is quite faster than others, which I feel sometimes wastes or accidentally gives me too much product).

Above all, this left my skin better than it found it. It truly gets into every crevice and pore and detoxes my face - I can feel the oil and dirt being pulled every time I massage it in.

customer_review-R3QCJFPMAEEO49,B0B45M89LX,"No scent, easy to emulsify, feels nice but not for acne prone. *UPDATED*",3.0,"July 10, 2023",Sara,1,"I recently tried out the Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Cleansing Oil with high hopes for the ""double-cleansing"" method. It really does make your skin glow and feel soft, but it of course made me break out. While my experience wasn't entirely negative, I can't help but come back to warn my fellow acne friends that may be guided here because of skinfluencers.

Starting with the positives, I was pleased to discover that the cleansing oil is fragrance-free despite seeing some reviews about the scent. This is a definite plus for those who are sensitive to scents or prefer their skincare products to be scentless. The ingredient list also caught my attention. True to its word, the oil did leave my skin feeling more moisturized and supple after use. The natural ingredients seemed promising and aligned with my skincare goals.

However, despite religiously following the double-cleansing routine, this cleansing oil unfortunately triggered painful breakouts on my skin. I had hoped that it would either improve my acne situation or at the very least not exacerbate it. Sadly, this wasn't the case. If anything, I felt that my pores were getting clogged and my breakouts were becoming more persistent and so so red/inflamed.

As we all know skincare can be highly individual, and what works for one person might not work for another. Some people will swear double cleansing can't possibly make you break out because you're washing it off, but I've realized my face can't handle any oil of any kind even though I have combination skin. I'm convinced that double-cleansing does not actually get it all off and you need to triple/quad cleanse, which just doesn't sound efficient or necessary to me.",32,2025-04-15 17:49:02

I’ve tried using it for a week along with different types of makeup; bases, foundation, setting spray, etc. It’s okay at getting rid of the makeup that breaks down throughout the day. But it’s horrible at breaking through the all nighter spray along with my foundation which I tend to scrub really hard around my eyes and nose area.

For anyone who is looking for that, it’s great. I know it’s a good product but I must admit that I prefer a thicker cleansing oil. If you’re looking to avoid mineral oil, glycerin, fragrance etc., this is for you. I know it says it is Acne Safe, but just a word of caution would be that it contains Olive oil derivatives. Olive oil can cause breakouts in some Acne prone skin types. When in doubt refer and become familiar with The Comedogenic Rating Scale. A quick google search is all you need!

I’ve tried the toner and the two types of sunscreen: tube and stick. I love the tube sunscreen so much I stocked up 3 just to have on hand.

Now moving on to this oil cleanser. It is advertised for all skin types and “without clogging skin pores”. I tend to be on the oily side and I really should be using products that are noncomedogenic (non clogging) but soy bean oil is highly comedogenic and not recommended for oily people, like me. I’ve used it for about a week and so far I don’t really see a change but a week is just not long enough to tell a difference. I’ll probably update this review when I’m done using the bottle because we do not waste here!

To the product itself. It feels very light and not thick at all. 3 pumps get the job done. It has an earthy smell but very mild which I personally don’t mind. It’s used on dry skin but once in contact with water, it turns this milky white that washes off no problem. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry right after using it.

Do with this information how you will but I’ll probably purchase a different brand with a different type of oil base after I finish this bottle.",15,2025-04-15 17:49:05

I wanted to really try it out to give a fair assessment. I’m a person that wears makeup 5 days a week for work. I’m no MAC artist but I wear a decent amount.

I am almost 100% guaranteed to get a pimple/clogged pore the day after I use this product. For context I have a multi step skincare regime which includes a double cleanse and it STILL clogs my pores.

1. A little goes a long way, as with all Beauty of Joseon products. I love them all by the way.
2. Very nice and smooth going on my face. I look forward to using it almost everyday. I switch up with the Joseon Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser but I like this cleansing balm better. It feels like I’m rubbing luxury on my skin. Face and neck.
3. I do not wear makeup. This is not just for makeup removal! I use it to clean my face and I do not have to follow up with a face wash. This works fine on its own.
4. This is the only cleansing product that shrinks the strawberry pores on my nose! Beauty of Joseon Red Bean Refreshing Pore Mask also works but it’s not a cleanser and I do not use it everyday like this cleansing balm.
5. It goes on like an oily cream but rinses off like water. That doesn’t make sense does it? I’m trying to say it’s not a messy and it rinses right off easily!
6. My face feels so smooth and hydrated when I’m finished! Of course I still follow up with my moisturizers (mixsoon and castor oil), but it doesn’t leave my face ridiculously dry like some other products.

I'm a guy so I wasn't looking to remove a lot of make-up or anything just a cleansing option that's super moisturizing for my dry skin especially as I'm getting older and seeing more lines. It leaves your skin feeling clean but soft and hydrated. My only complaint is that I started to get more breakouts and large pimples after a month or so of using it. I never break but it's kind of a given with a balmy product like this and my skin but it was great while it lasted.

customer_review-R3SOHVURJW7ES8,B0B3R661JP,Fantastic find for dry and fragile skin,5.0,"November 30, 2024",Ecstatic Thrum,1,"About a year or two ago, my normally soft, supple and clear skin took a complete and total dive.

Unfortunately serving as a harbinger for the health problems underlying its condition.

And while I'm still knee deep in identifying all the moving parts of my health problems.

My hope was to at least be able to calm my wildly reactive skin at the surface level.

This luxurious cleansing balm breaks down the day's buildup and rinses so beautifully that I've used it for both face and body as all of the skin on this sweet body has become *practically* hydrophobic.

For the face, I use this as part of a double cleanse with a brilliant enzymatic rice powder that turns into this lovely marshmallow-y cleanser.

And finish with a rice cream moisturizer to seal in the feeling of gently exfoliated, baby soft skin.

Rice skincare has been an absolute game-changer for me and my dry, flaky, rosacea-prone, eczema-prone skin.

Hoping next to switch out my witch hazel and mineral sunscreen for a rice-based toner and rice-based sunscreen formulated for dry skin... yes, they do exist <3

customer_review-R2QDXQHJ81R9H4,B0B3R661JP,Reminds me of Lilah B but without the fragrance! 😍,5.0,"August 1, 2024",Kathryn Magendie,1,"I loved my Lilah B cleansing balm so much I was sad when they went out of business. The only thing was Lilah B had a strong fragrance added, but it was a beautiful fragrance so I didn't mind.

I haven't found one that matched that perfect feeling of spreading on my facial skin smoothly and then turning to a beautiful oil-like texture and then washing away cleanly. I'm sure they are out there, I just didn't find one that I liked or compared to LB. Until this Beauty of Joseon cleansing balm!

I do love everything BOJ, so I am biased :) but this cleansing balm goes on so beautifully, spreads easily, and turns to a gorgeous texture on my skin. Easy to wash away. No fragrance, which is great if you have sensitive skin.

I don't double cleanse in the morning - I use BOJ ginger cleansing oil, which I also love as it cleans my face without drying it out. But, when I wear sunscreen and/or makeup, I will double cleanse. I use this balm first and then follow up with their Green Plum cleansing gel.

I have slight rosacea-prone skin and this does not irritate it. In face, the BOJ line is helping my rosacea - in particular their green tea serum calms the redness (along with CosRx snail mucin -gross but effective!).

And the price is so reasonable like all of BOJ products.

customer_review-R2YYCMGTK3QEB5,B0B3R661JP,"Unscented, Easy to Use",5.0,"April 10, 2024",Abby,1,"I bought this for travel. I usually use a face oil but felt that having a cleansing balm in solid form is easier to toss into a travel bag. This melts and spreads easily on the skin and includes a little paddle for you to scoop out the balm.

Before I apply makeup to my face, I will apply it to the back of my hand. This easily takes off Bobby Brown eyeliner gel make up and MAC concealer makeup. Once I saw that, I knew that this was a winner.

This won’t necessarily dissolve your mascara, though. If I wear mascara, I reach for a facial oil because that has the power to dissolve the mascara after a bit of gentle massage. To dissolve mascara using this, you need to use a bit more than usual, and have patience when massaging this into your lashes to break down the mascara. It will take a little more time and work compared to a facial oil, but it can be done.

I highly recommend this if you travel and don’t want to worry about a facial oil leaking in your luggage. If you wear a lot of mascara, I recommend you pack a small amount of facial oil (put it in a Ziplock baggie and a plastic bag to prevent leaks) to help break down the mascara.",8,2025-04-15 17:49:54

My skin felt like butter afterwards, but in a good way. It was soft and silky whilst not being greasy. It washes off with just water incredibly well without needing to use any cotton pads or a towel. Just put the balm on dry skin, rub it in for around 2-3 minutes, and wash it off with water (whether that be in your sink or your shower). I, personally, don’t think I’d like need to use a water-based cleanser afterwards, but it never hurts to go in with a regular facial cleanser to really make sure you’ve removed any remaining residue/dirt/oil (though it does this well by itself).

customer_review-R159R466X61Q1K,B0B3R661JP,Just what I wanted!,5.0,"December 5, 2022",kirabira,1,"I live in a building with ancient plumbing, and my oil cleansing stage was destroying my pipes because over time the layers of washed off jojoba oil would add up and get the pipes clogged and make the sink drain so slow and then I'd have to have one of the maintenance guys come in to clean the pipes and it was a whole production. Not ideal!!

So I've been wanting to try out a cleansing balm that rinses a bit cleaner and doesn't stay oily and mess up my pipes.

So far so good! A little of this stuff goes a long way, which is nice. It smells nice, has nice packaging, easy to use, gets my makeup and daytime lotions and potions off, then I follow with a wipe or micellar water and we're good to go for nighttime lotions and potions! (I only use it at night.)

Overall, very successful! I'll likely repurchase whenever I run out, but I don't anticipate that being any time soon because you truly don't need to use very much so this container will likely last me like 6-9 months.",23,2025-04-15 17:50:02

This product is nice because it does not have Ethylhexyl Palmitate which can be irritating (though who knows b/c it is not on the skin long), but more importantly it is not derived from palm oil which has negative consequences for the environment. Helps remove sunscreen decently and is comparable to the other balms I listed.

Here is my routine: 1) w/ clean hands, apply to dry face 2) massage for ~1', emulsify the balm with a bit of water and massage lightly for 30"" 3) Follow up with a 2nd cleanser to ensure all product is removed.",16,2025-04-15 17:50:05

I like the paper that the mask is on because it makes it easier to open up the mask from the packet and put it on my face.

I primarily use this as a facial cleanser, but you can use this on your body as well. I was a bit skeptical to use a bar cleanser, but that changed as soon as l used it. I have dry sensitive skin so wasn't expecting much, but l'm so happy l found this. It gives a lovely soft leather, feels great on
the skin, leaves your skin clean and soft, with no tightness. I'd much rather use this than the expensive Estee Lauder gel cleanser l was using before. Not only does this do a better job, but it is a fractions of the price.
My Husband even tried it and now using it as well. I will definitely keep purchasing this.",5,2025-04-15 17:52:52

Update:This has been the third day, I have been using the Rice Bar on my Skin. Day and Night.. let me tell you this makes your SKIN SO SOFT! And it gives you a natural Glow!!!!

customer_review-R3P6HI735AT01I,B09N8NGJ77,Surprisingly Gentle,5.0,"December 23, 2023",Beth Ross,1,"I have sensitive, reactive, dehydrated and normal to dry skin. I easily break out when my skin is overstripped or the barrier is compromised in any way. For years I have been unable to use any cleanser that is foaming or sudsing in any way and have had to use only lotion type cleansers. I thought I would try this as I love other products from this line and the price was very reasonable. I am so surprised to say that I have been able to use this twice a day for so long that I went through an entire bar and bought two more! It foams nicely, and I have missed being able to use a foamy cleanser. The lather/foam it creates is thick and sift, and while it does leave my face a bit dry and tight, it has caused zero irritation or compromise to my skin barrier. I always follow with toners, essences, serums, and moisturizers regardless of my cleanser, so the initial tightness is not bothersome. While it does dry a bit, it doesn’t seem to actually dehydrate my skin. Best of all, it keeps my skin clear and bright better than almost any cleanser I have ever used. I am so shocked by this bar, not at all what I expect from this type of soap. So pleased!!",19,2025-04-15 17:52:52

I’m assuming this is the “earthy woodsy” scent, but it smells almost like baby powder to me and is kind of off-putting. It is very light and hydrating, very easy to spread on and lasts all day. If I saw this in a standalone shop and got the chance to smell it first, I’d give it a pass.

While I think the moisturizer is a bit expensive, I love the fragrance. The lotion works really well, and my skin (legs/arms) feels great after applying the moisturizer. I’m sold on the scent though.

customer_review-RHCZYMAMRNWOI,B0C43QBRHX,Deeply moisturizes,4.0,"May 13, 2023",ItsMe,0,"This cream is lightweight and creamy. It gets absorbed into the skin quickly, leaving the skin feeling soft and silky.

Deeply moisturizes my hands while getting rid of the skin fissures and dryness due to winter weather and over washing.

It does have an overpowering musky scent that I really don't like and it lingers for a long time even after washing the hands multiple times. I've realized it's the strong scent of pine.

Now let's talk about the packaging. The pump does not have an arrow like a standard pump does showing which way to turn to open and close so you're left turning both ways hoping that the pump pops up. It took about 5 minutes of turning to finally figure out that you have to push in the middle of the pump to make it pop up!

Very fragrant floral pine scent. The cream is thick and comes in a pump bottle. It is moisturizing, but personally I'm not a huge fan of the pine scent. Fragrance wise it is so strong that it can double as perfume if you put some on your wrist or your neck area.

I had a hard time with the pump when I tried to loosen it. I turned it so many times and it wouldn't come up. Eventually I turned it while pulling up and it seemed to work. Don't ask me which way I turned it tho lol.

It is a nice and thick body cream that does moisturize the body, however, due to the extreme scent, it's not for me. But if you like the floral pine scent and don't mind the fragrance, I say try it out!",0,2025-04-15 17:54:16

It's subtle and suitable for men and women. It goes on smooth and absorbs well. It's not sticky but my skin feels hydrated.
The issue that took one star away from the rating is the price. Many moisturizers can do the job for a fraction of the price. $25,....really!?

It's not sticky, absorbs well into the skin. The texture is pretty thick, so applied out of the shower it really helps as an occlusive to keep in moisture. The ingredients include shea, olive oils, my fav propanediol, a bunch of just really nice hydrating products. The formulation overall looks really clean.

I love this fragrance. It isn't max pine-y, it's really a nicely accessible clean scent. Not too strong, but pleasant powdery... it's difficult to really describe. The listing for the associated perfume shows:

TOP : Bergamot / Pine / Leafy Green / Eucalyptus
MIDDLE : Iris / Lavender / Lotus / Rosemary
BASE : Sandalwood / Patchouli / Cedarwood / Musk

I don't have the perfume to speak of how similar they are., but iris would certainly explain the powder. I don't get a strong read on patchouli here, which I am one of those people pretty sensitive to it if it's not well blended. I love this. I'm a huge fan of this scent.

Before I ordered, I did read the product description which I found totally misleading. When it said ""Pine Grove Scent (Concentration 0.5%)"", it sounded as if they were natural scent. Turned out that was not the case.

customer_review-R2A33QVGJE6LFG,B01CVXRAVK,Thin and pricey.,3.0,"April 16, 2023",$earching 4 deals,0,I have heard people hype up this brand. Maybe other products are better. But I felt this Beauty of Joseon Pine Grove : Body Wash was just average. The body wash has a thinness to it much more so than other body washes I have used. I am not a fan of strong pine scents and this one luckily didn’t smell like a pine forest or holiday tree. Can’t quite pin down the actual scent though. This body wash does lather some and will do what a body wash does…get you clean. But it will also clean out your wallet as it is pricey for what it is. I can buy 2 or 3 other brands that work just as well or better for cheaper.,0,2025-04-15 17:55:37

For the price and quantity, I was expecting that it had to be really impressive. When using it, I can really feel a difference between this versus other body washes. It produces a really rich lather and using a wash cloth or loofah is a better option. It feels like it thickens up more if you used it with it and takes more effort to apply everywhere. When washing, it feels like it cleans well while not stripping the skin dry. It's a luxurious feeling during and after showering. I'm really surprised that it is able to help remove dead skin and help with better skin.

In addition, the earthy fragrance smells great and can work for both men and women. Overall, I'm very impressed with this product.",0,2025-04-15 17:55:39

It came in a tape-sealed box, and in a plastic, push-down spout dispenser bottle.

The body wash has a wonderful pine scent, the subtle kind, like Christmas trees, not artificial-smelling. This also lathers extremely well, cleans well, and leaves a nice pine scent on my skin. At the current $25 price, it is more expensive than I would normally spend on myself, but I'd totally put it on my wishlist and would love to receive it as a gift.

Despite the pump’s fat appearance, it is a traditional pump not a foaming one; a single push squirts out a generous dose.
The scent is a very earthy woodsy one that lingers like a cologne. It smells somewhere between a spa and a man.

My skin's been relatively decent forever but my hormones have been terrible lately. I woke up and it was almost like my skin's barrier was gone and I kept getting cystic acne. For reference, I'm 26, and this was completely out of the blue. However, I've always had overly red cheeks (not rosacea but just thin skin), I thought maybe there'd be WAY to change that. Nope! The Glow Deep Serum and the Calm Serum changed the game! My face is evening out by the day. And the GLOW. I told my best friend, ""I literally wear a full face of makeup every day of my life and I truly love my skin and I feel like I really almost don't need it. This is CRAZY.""

Second Pic: Makeup but you can see the glow from underneath AND you can see how hydrated my skin is and the texture improving. Unfortunate I didn't take any pictures when my skin was dying but. YES. get this.

My full routine:

Double Cleanse:
- Beekman 1802's Milk Wash Exfoliating Jelly (Cleanse alone with this and if you have sensitive skin you will fight me later. My skin hated me at first until I combined the Cetaphil but it wasn't nearly as bad as aveeno's ""sensitive"" skin line. That brand and facewash is TERRIBLE.
- Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (My fav and so cheap)
Toner:
-The Saem ""Drop Be"" (Purchased when I went to Busan last winter but you can find it on Ebay)
Serums: I use all four of these- I introduced two then four at a time to address problem areas.
Face Mask:
-Mediheal ( My favorites are the Collagen ones and the WaterMide as they don't irritate my sensitive AF skin at all)
Eye Mask:
-Florence (the purple ones for undereye bags) Absolutely obsessed because I have terrible
undereye bags thanks to genetics. The definitely help with puffiness and discoloration. I've been using them for months now.
Lip scrub/Lip Mask:
-Bath and body works vanilla (so good I want a different one though since I like brand exploration but it's SO hydrating and it is great for a no-makeup clean girl look)
Barrier Cream/Skin life changer x2:
-ETUDE Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream Hypoallergenic",47,2025-04-15 17:56:46

No silicones yet glide on as if they do. From the ingredients it appears they are not full of fillers at all. Great texture yet absorb quickly, leaving your skin feeling plumped. I've noticed a big change in my pore size and blackheads which is my biggest skin concern. The first couple of weeks I didn't notice a change but then all of a sudden it was like night and day. Will be purchasing large bottles of these. The one I can do without is the green serum for redness, I do not have that as an issue so I will not be purchasing that one.

My take on the four included are: 2 out of three of them are very sticky and feel terrible on the skin. I would absolutely pass on the Glow Deep Serum because of the tacky sticky grossness of it. I dont care how good it is, it never absorbs and just sits on top of your skin. The second worse was the Revive serum, it was also very sticky and never really dries or absorbs into the skin.

The two that I liked were the Green Tea and Panthenol as well as the Glow Serum with Propolis and Niacinamide. The green tea one absorbed nicely into the skin. The regular glow serum with propolis and Niacinamide was also pretty nice. It had a little bit of a tacky feeling but absorbed nicely into the skin after a little while.

None of them broke me out or made my skin turn red with a patch test on my arm. I would reorder the ladder two. None of them had much of a smell at all either which I really liked. I cant stand fragrances so that was a plus.",3,2025-04-15 17:56:49

This made me nervous for what was to come after this faded away, but when it did, the scent was lovely. I could smell the point, as well as other elements within the perfume. It was forward but gentle in scent and carries well through the day. I am a lover of things pine and forest-like, and this gives a wonderful reminiscence of just that. It's light but delivers well. I even got a few compliments on this my first time wearing it. The scent is not feminine or masculine, it is quite neutral. I will be repurchasing this when I am through with my bottle.

Nevertheless, it is a wonderfully light and soft scent that is floral-focused with woody notes of pine and sandalwood. It could be gender-neutral but I definitely get a more feminine vibe from it.

Definitely a lovely scent and does evoke the imagery of a pine grove in bright sunlight. I will use and enjoy this product but likely won't purchase it again unless it goes on sale (which is why I bought it in the first place) Love BoJ products and will be shopping with them again for my skincare needs!",0,2025-04-15 17:57:42

It's described as a pine scent, which I can pick up on when I first spray it, but it fades into a more perfumey, floralish scent. I normally don't like perfumey or floral but there's something different about this one. It's comforting and pleasant. The different notes work really well together and it definitely isn't something that'll leave you smelling just like every other woman in the room, it's different (in a good way!) It is a K product and I can't read anything on the box itself, so I'm only going on what the description page says that the notes are.

customer_review-R1AFD2YTSW0HU3,B01CVXRCR2,Too earthy and woody for my liking,1.0,"April 24, 2023",Melissa,0,"- Upon spraying this perfume for the first time i was immediately repelled. It came off really strong and sharp. The eucalyptus note at the opening combined with pine note reminded me of an essential oil but not in a good way. I generally like bergamot note in perfumes but unfortunately i did not pick up this note in this perfume.
- The dry down is a tad too earthy and woody for my liking. Sadly i just don't like how the eucalyptus note lingers in the dry down and mixes with the base notes. It throws me off.
- The longevity is also not great. It lasts about 2 hours on me.

Its quite a mix of flowers minus the 'rose' that seems to be popular trend now. In my book this is a plus since I'm not a fan of 'rose' perfumes.
Its quite a balanced multi flower floral scent. Very natural smelling. The pine is an interesting background addition that if you pay attention you can notice it. Its like standing in a flower field next to a pine forest.

Very summer leaning for sure. Feminine mixed floral is how I would describe it. Worth a try if you are really into florals. Longevity seems to be about 5 hours on skin or a day+ on your clothing.",0,2025-04-15 17:57:48
