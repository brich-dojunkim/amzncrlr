customer_review-R2R7YFK4YB2Y9F,B0C43QBRHX,love it!,5.0,"December 3, 2024",Anon,1,"i think this is a great formula that’s thick enough to moisturize well but not too thick where it doesn’t absorb and ends up being sticky. the scent is more pine-adjacent than actual pine, but i find the fragrance to be soft an elegant. the scent doesn’t linger and isn’t too strong.",0,2025-04-15 12:39:58
customer_review-RN4LN9JANWVX2,B0C43QBRHX,Needs more pine scent,4.0,"May 20, 2023",Amazon Customer,0,"I can smell a hint of pine, and it’s great – until it’s overwhelmed by some other scent. I’m assuming this is the “earthy woodsy” scent, but it smells almost like baby powder to me and is kind of off-putting. It is very light and hydrating, very easy to spread on and lasts all day. If I saw this in a standalone shop and got the chance to smell it first, I’d give it a pass. Scents are very personal things though and this probably smells perfectly amazing for many others out there.

customer_review-R3UVCDCD0MZR64,B0C43QBRHX,Expensive for a moisturizer…but it smells so good,5.0,"June 23, 2024",Oxymoron_Deli,1,"Okay, I bought this moisturizer as a general body lotion and I’ve heard great things about Beauty of Joseon products. While I think the moisturizer is a bit expensive, I love the fragrance. The lotion works really well, and my skin (legs/arms) feels great after applying the moisturizer. I’m sold on the scent though. It’s strong at first but drys down to be a light, aromatic fragrance. It doesn’t last all day sadly, but I would buy a perfume with this fragrance profile.",0,2025-04-15 12:39:58
customer_review-R1SBH4OO3HFR29,B0C43QBRHX,In Love,5.0,"June 11, 2024",Leigh,1,"I just received this lotion and used it for the first time and absolutely love it. I love anything pine scented. It's hard to find pine scents so I was so excited to come across this by accident. I see a lot of people buying products from Garden of Joseon so I already trusted them as being really good quality. If you love pine scents, you have to try this. The cream itself is so silky. It feels amazing on my arm. So happy I came across this!",0,2025-04-15 12:39:58
customer_review-RHCZYMAMRNWOI,B0C43QBRHX,Deeply moisturizes,4.0,"May 13, 2023",ItsMe,0,"This cream is lightweight and creamy. It gets absorbed into the skin quickly, leaving the skin feeling soft and silky.

Deeply moisturizes my hands while getting rid of the skin fissures and dryness due to winter weather and over washing.

It does have an overpowering musky scent that I really don't like and it lingers for a long time even after washing the hands multiple times. I've realized it's the strong scent of pine.

Now let's talk about the packaging. The pump does not have an arrow like a standard pump does showing which way to turn to open and close so you're left turning both ways hoping that the pump pops up. It took about 5 minutes of turning to finally figure out that you have to push in the middle of the pump to make it pop up! You'd think for the price that you pay for such a small bottle that they would at least add that to the pump.",0,2025-04-15 12:39:58

customer_review-R3P5Z2VZF30Y53,B0C43QBRHX,Pump difficult to open. Extreme floral pine fragrance. Is moisturizing.,4.0,"May 18, 2023",Papaya,0,"This review is for Beauty of Joseon Pine Grove : Body Cream (400ml, 13.5 fl.oz)

Very fragrant floral pine scent. The cream is thick and comes in a pump bottle. It is moisturizing, but personally I'm not a huge fan of the pine scent. Fragrance wise it is so strong that it can double as perfume if you put some on your wrist or your neck area.

I had a hard time with the pump when I tried to loosen it. I turned it so many times and it wouldn't come up. Eventually I turned it while pulling up and it seemed to work. Don't ask me which way I turned it tho lol.

It is a nice and thick body cream that does moisturize the body, however, due to the extreme scent, it's not for me. But if you like the floral pine scent and don't mind the fragrance, I say try it out!",0,2025-04-15 12:40:01
customer_review-R3MGN7RKF958RP,B0C43QBRHX,Very nice (but expensive) moisturizer,4.0,"May 15, 2023",f.biscus,0,"This is some nice, good quality, moisturizer. Not too thick, not too thin. Smells nice. Fragrance is almost the most important thing to me. The description of the scent is accurate - like walking through a cool pine forest with a hint of floral notes... It's subtle and suitable for men and women. It goes on smooth and absorbs well. It's not sticky but my skin feels hydrated.
The issue that took one star away from the rating is the price. Many moisturizers can do the job for a fraction of the price. $25,....really!? I admit I'll miss it when I run out because I love the fragrance, but I wouldn't purchase another bottle. It claims to have anti-aging benefits if used over a long period of time, but who has time for that?",0,2025-04-15 12:40:01
customer_review-RK60RJYX3IQ3L,B0C43QBRHX,"Lovely, clean fragrance.",5.0,"July 24, 2023",James W.,0,"I don't know if I can really speak tot he anti-aging part of the claims in the product, but overall this is a really lovely body cream. It's not sticky, absorbs well into the skin. The texture is pretty thick, so applied out of the shower it really helps as an occlusive to keep in moisture. The ingredients include shea, olive oils, my fav propanediol, a bunch of just really nice hydrating products. The formulation overall looks really clean.

I love this fragrance. It isn't max pine-y, it's really a nicely accessible clean scent. Not too strong, but pleasant powdery... it's difficult to really describe. The listing for the associated perfume shows:

TOP : Bergamot / Pine / Leafy Green / Eucalyptus
MIDDLE : Iris / Lavender / Lotus / Rosemary
BASE : Sandalwood / Patchouli / Cedarwood / Musk

I don't have the perfume to speak of how similar they are., but iris would certainly explain the powder. I don't get a strong read on patchouli here, which I am one of those people pretty sensitive to it if it's not well blended. I love this. I'm a huge fan of this scent. Overall this is really nicely done, a well-executed product, I'll definitely be trying the body wash. Maybe the perfume.",3,2025-04-15 12:40:01

It has a nice moisturizing effect without being too thick or heavy and absorbs easily into the skin. My sensitive skin hasn't had any issues after using it for a few days. It has nice packaging that feels high-end like most other Korean skin products.

It is definitely moisturizing, and it isn’t super heavy, which I like. I’m not sure I care for the pine w/flower scent, but that’s a personal thing so I don’t hold it against the product. I think it’s a good lotion, but I will give it to a family member who cares for the scent more than I do.",0,2025-04-15 12:40:01

I am sensitive to scent- and this is very heavily scented. I can't quite place the scent- it is piney and floral- an unusual combination. I am sure that many would find this scent appealing, but it just not is for me.",0,2025-04-15 12:40:01

It isn’t a surface level moisturizer for sure — this provides lasting hydration and softness.

I like the light pine scent although I did have to get used to it as the “floral” part of the scent doesn’t seem to blend well with the pine scent to me. It doesn’t linger and I do enjoy the freshness of the scent more now. My right elbow got really rough after recuperating from a surgery and spending a lot of time leaning on it in bed watching shows. 😊 I applied moisturizers, oils, etc. and nothing really helped until I got this cream. I put it on every night after showering.",0,2025-04-15 12:40:05

It also absorbs nicely into the skin, and after a few minutes, I don't feel any residual greasy layer left behind. The scent is also light enough that it doesn't bother me -- and I'm particularly sensitive to scents (my nose AND my skin), so that's saying a lot.

Unbelievably good – feels extremely high-end.,5.0,"May 20, 2023",Wesley Roberts,0,"This is one of the best body moisturizers I’ve used, and I’ve tried many throughout the years. It has a silky-smooth texture and feels sufficiently nourishing without being sticky or greasy or taking too long to sink in. The scent is just divine. Personally, I’m very adverse to overly sweet scents and find them quite sickening. This moisturizer isn't very sweet and smells like a pine forest - I really can’t get enough of it. It’s one of the few free Vine products that I will order again at full price once I run out. It's expensive, but not more so than other high-end moisturizers.
