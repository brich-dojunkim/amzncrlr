customer_review-R2LHFNTXCKMASX,B0D1G75VN6,Good stuff,5.0,"January 6, 2025",Stephanie Covert,1,"I got this to use with my gua sha,I needed somthing that wasn't to expensive,came with a decent amount of product,didn't irritate my skin amd that would absorb and not sit on top of my skin or give me a greedy oily feel and this does all that. It moisturizes decently,dosnt absorb to fast so it's good for the gua sha amd I was suprized with the amount you get for the price and it's also a clean ingredient product which is super important to me as well",0,2025-04-15 12:44:46

customer_review-R1TOTNAWM8LGFC,B0D1G75VN6,Fast Absorbing Cream,5.0,"January 14, 2025",FrozenNorth,1,Really nice cream that initially has just enough slip to massage well and then melts into skin leaving it smooth and plump. Very neutral light scent. Large tube will last a long time.,0,2025-04-15 12:44:47
customer_review-R1E17B00NMD3CB,B0D1G75VN6,Good moisturizer cream,3.0,"September 3, 2024",Anna O.,1,Mediocre cream. I expected more thinking that this cream will be better to use it for massage. But I don't know the difference between my regular cream from home,0,2025-04-15 12:44:47
customer_review-RE6H65NG7BVTI,B0D1G75VN6,Nice!,5.0,"June 22, 2024",Pepto Bismol,1,"I love beauty of joseon but for some reason I was a bit nervous to try a body lotion, turns out i was nervius for nothing because i liked this product. The ingredients aren't harmful or toxic, there's no intense artificial scent (it kinda smells like plants), it's moisturizing just like any other lotion but not too thick and not too thin and it's easy to work with. It leaves a thin coating on the skin unless you really like it on but this is a product where a little can go a long way.",3,2025-04-15 12:44:47
