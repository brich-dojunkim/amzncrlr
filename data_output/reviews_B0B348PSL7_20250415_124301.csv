customer_review-R1V9GOS6DKQCWT,B0B348PSL7,Versatile and layerable; My complexion has never looked better,5.0,"September 1, 2024",Kai,1,"I want to say that I truly love these products. My skin's been relatively decent forever but my hormones have been terrible lately. I woke up and it was almost like my skin's barrier was gone and I kept getting cystic acne. For reference, I'm 26, and this was completely out of the blue. However, I've always had overly red cheeks (not rosacea but just thin skin), I thought maybe there'd be WAY to change that. Nope! The Glow Deep Serum and the Calm Serum changed the game! My face is evening out by the day. And the GLOW. I told my best friend, ""I literally wear a full face of makeup every day of my life and I truly love my skin and I feel like I really almost don't need it. This is CRAZY.""

First pic: No Makeup the lip product is a lip mask from Bath and body works
Second Pic: Makeup but you can see the glow from underneath AND you can see how hydrated my skin is and the texture improving. Unfortunate I didn't take any pictures when my skin was dying but. YES. get this.

My full routine:

Double Cleanse:
- Beekman 1802's Milk Wash Exfoliating Jelly (Cleanse alone with this and if you have sensitive skin you will fight me later. My skin hated me at first until I combined the Cetaphil but it wasn't nearly as bad as aveeno's ""sensitive"" skin line. That brand and facewash is TERRIBLE.
- Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser (My fav and so cheap)
Toner:
-The Saem ""Drop Be"" (Purchased when I went to Busan last winter but you can find it on Ebay)
Serums: I use all four of these- I introduced two then four at a time to address problem areas.
Face Mask:
-Mediheal ( My favorites are the Collagen ones and the WaterMide as they don't irritate my sensitive AF skin at all)
Eye Mask:
-Florence (the purple ones for undereye bags) Absolutely obsessed because I have terrible
undereye bags thanks to genetics. The definitely help with puffiness and discoloration. I've been using them for months now.
Lip scrub/Lip Mask:
-Bath and body works vanilla (so good I want a different one though since I like brand exploration but it's SO hydrating and it is great for a no-makeup clean girl look)
Barrier Cream/Skin life changer x2:
-ETUDE Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream Hypoallergenic",47,2025-04-15 12:42:33

They're gentle but effective. I liked that they all came in a set to try them all out and I liked them all enough that I bought them all in the full size and use them everyday. My skin is sensitive and acne prone and these have not irritated by skin one bit nor caused any breakouts. None of them are oily at all!

customer_review-R1A8N84GVP0FLN,B0B348PSL7,WOW,5.0,"December 16, 2024",bbcw421,1,"These serums are so so so good. I love skin care and am always trying new brands and products, very experienced and cosmetology licensed. I love these. The way the main ingredient in the products are the first or second listed is excellent. The price is a great way to try these, and they have a gorgeous texture. No silicones yet glide on as if they do. From the ingredients it appears they are not full of fillers at all. Great texture yet absorb quickly, leaving your skin feeling plumped. I've noticed a big change in my pore size and blackheads which is my biggest skin concern. The first couple of weeks I didn't notice a change but then all of a sudden it was like night and day. Will be purchasing large bottles of these. The one I can do without is the green serum for redness, I do not have that as an issue so I will not be purchasing that one. I also bought the rice milk toner and love it as well. I am very interested in trying the eye serum and the masks. Great brand, this has sold me.",3,2025-04-15 12:42:33

customer_review-RDAYDOIVTPR1V,B0B348PSL7,Good but not Great,3.0,"May 25, 2024",brodie,1,"All of these serums worked and I loved them. But I believe that there are much better serums out there than these. In this kit, the serums actually come very small and are used fairly quickly. Most of them are very great for sensitive skins and work well with texture and acne but there are much better serums that treat the same things that these do. I would use these if your just getting into skincare but if your looking for specific serums to treat specific things these are a waste of your time and money. They do all smell great though and have a great consistency and weight on the skin.",3,2025-04-15 12:42:33

I must be careful about the products I buy so that my skin will be free from irritation. Two of the bottles had oils that were too harsh, and two were just so so.

Then a couple days later I tried the snail serum and the next day I had SO many closed comedones all over my face! At first I thought it was just something I had ate, but then I researched it and found out it was closed comedones (basically where oil and dirt get trapped under your pores and create bumps). Plus I never break out from food.
And it took almost a week to get rid of it.
So I suggest you buy them separately...and the size well it's super tiny so yeah.",3,2025-04-15 12:42:36

customer_review-R1SP79QVR1UQW7,B0B348PSL7,Serum Sample Packs‚Ä¶good way to tell what not to order,3.0,"August 24, 2024",L-izzy,1,"I bought the Beauty by Joseon Serum Discovery Kit and I am glad I didn't spend the money on the larger individual ones. My take on the four included are: 2 out of three of them are very sticky and feel terrible on the skin. I would absolutely pass on the Glow Deep Serum because of the tacky sticky grossness of it. I dont care how good it is, it never absorbs and just sits on top of your skin. The second worse was the Revive serum, it was also very sticky and never really dries or absorbs into the skin.

The two that I liked were the Green Tea and Panthenol as well as the Glow Serum with Propolis and Niacinamide. The green tea one absorbed nicely into the skin. The regular glow serum with propolis and Niacinamide was also pretty nice. It had a little bit of a tacky feeling but absorbed nicely into the skin after a little while.

None of them broke me out or made my skin turn red with a patch test on my arm. I would reorder the ladder two. None of them had much of a smell at all either which I really liked. I cant stand fragrances so that was a plus.",3,2025-04-15 12:42:37

Based on the weather, your activities and your environment your skin may need different things to soothe it. This has 4 different serums, all can be used together, or at different times, and left my skin feeling and looking great.
