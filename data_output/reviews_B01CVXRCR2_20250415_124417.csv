customer_review-R12HILMDAH7DQ4,B01CVXRCR2,I am a lover of things pine and forest-like,5.0,"March 16, 2023",Tristan Tyler,1,"When I first sprayed this perfume, I was thrown off by the powdery and alcohol smell it gave off. This made me nervous for what was to come after this faded away, but when it did, the scent was lovely. I could smell the point, as well as other elements within the perfume. It was forward but gentle in scent and carries well through the day. I am a lover of things pine and forest-like, and this gives a wonderful reminiscence of just that. It's light but delivers well. I even got a few compliments on this my first time wearing it. The scent is not feminine or masculine, it is quite neutral. I will be repurchasing this when I am through with my bottle. Side note, this pairs wonderfully with the body wash and cream.",10,2025-04-15 12:43:31
customer_review-R1NBTNJOSHRVT4,B01CVXRCR2,Overall good fragrance,4.0,"November 3, 2024",Maya,1,"Like a lot of other reviews said, this fragrance definitely gives off a bit of a powdery scent and isn't as intensely pine-scented as I would have expected. Nevertheless, it is a wonderfully light and soft scent that is floral-focused with woody notes of pine and sandalwood. It could be gender-neutral but I definitely get a more feminine vibe from it.

Definitely a lovely scent and does evoke the imagery of a pine grove in bright sunlight. I will use and enjoy this product but likely won't purchase it again unless it goes on sale (which is why I bought it in the first place) Love BoJ products and will be shopping with them again for my skincare needs!",0,2025-04-15 12:43:31

customer_review-R3GCLNNDJ6OHE8,B01CVXRCR2,Pretty,5.0,"May 1, 2023",Reneerk,0,"I really like how this perfume smells. It's nice, light, and unique. It's described as a pine scent, which I can pick up on when I first spray it, but it fades into a more perfumey, floralish scent. I normally don't like perfumey or floral but there's something different about this one. It's comforting and pleasant. The different notes work really well together and it definitely isn't something that'll leave you smelling just like every other woman in the room, it's different (in a good way!) It is a K product and I can't read anything on the box itself, so I'm only going on what the description page says that the notes are. It lasts a decent amount of time on my clothes and skin and I like how as it fades, it smells different.",0,2025-04-15 12:43:32

customer_review-R2A3EP7SS0GDOW,B01CVXRCR2,This smells good,3.0,"May 6, 2023",Eugene,0,"This perfume has my favorite scents. The top notes are bergamot, pine, and eucalyptus. The middle notes are lavender, lotus, and rosemary. And the base notes are cedarwood and musk. This is fairly long lasting (a few hours) and is not overpowering. I like an elegant glass bottle. Receive compliments on this light floral scent. The main complaint is the scent isn't too strong for the price of $45. Other than that, I am completely satisfied.",2,2025-04-15 12:43:32
customer_review-RVARVK9V2C780,B01CVXRCR2,"Woody fragrance, doesn't last too long",3.0,"May 22, 2023",GGR,0,"This fragrance is true of the pine groves. Initially when I sprayed it, I didn't really like the fragrance that much but after a few minutes the fragrance was more soothing and a woody fragrance. It is not too strong but overall pleasing. One concern is that the fragrance doesn't last very long. In a few hours of spraying it, I could barely smell it. Considering the price, it is a bit expensive for short lived fragrance.",0,2025-04-15 12:43:32
customer_review-R2EFVA0C7VBWF1,B01CVXRCR2,Nice Fresh scent,3.0,"April 26, 2023",Cam,0,"The scent reminds me of walking in a pine forest for sure. It is a soft clean smell. The scent last throughout the day. I don‚Äôt see myself wearing it much personally, but I will use it to touch up the living room or maybe a bedroom because of its clean smell so I find it more functional as a room spray.",0,2025-04-15 12:43:34

customer_review-R3P7A9ZQ2EM87F,B01CVXRCR2,"Complex scent, not Pine Tree!",4.0,"April 27, 2023",lizardwitch,0,"First of all, I think the name gives the wrong impression as this is so much more than a so called pine grove! This, even when first applied is not piney, to me at least. Complex, kind of powdery, green earthy. I wish I could describe this adequately because it really deserves better description than mine! Even my husband couldn't pick out one particular note. I find it subtle and haven't worn enough to judge how long it lasts. Like it but does it deserve cost?

It‚Äôs very mature musky scented. Something I‚Äôd gift to my Yiayia üëµüèº if she was still around‚Ä¶.

customer_review-R2QINQVEE73CIG,B01CVXRCR2,it's pretty nice,4.0,"May 3, 2023",Perin,0,"this starts out with a strong, powdery pine scent that quickly fades into a more floral note, vaguely reminiscent of a bouquet, but without being too flowery and still retaining a kind of woodsy scent. I think this is a pretty gender-neutral fragrance.

I probably wouldn't get this again purely because it's not quite the kind of scent I like, but others I had smell it said they liked it.

this seems like it'd be great for gifting; the packaging made this very presentable.",0,2025-04-15 12:43:35
customer_review-R3ARQW1EL0MT6Z,B01CVXRCR2,Musky up front with a light woody floral finish,4.0,"April 25, 2023",Armorica,0,It‚Äôs a nice earthy scent. I was not sure what to think at first. It has a very musky scent right when you spray it on but soon mellows out. After it sits for a few minutes it does change to a soft earthy floral scent. It‚Äôs a mild scent that definitely can be unisex. It has a nice combination of musk and floral pine scents.,0,2025-04-15 12:43:35
customer_review-R32GYEXPVGBXJC,B01CVXRCR2,Powdery with pine undertones,4.0,"May 2, 2023",Amazon Customer,0,"As others have mentioned, this perfume is much more powdery when you first smell it! It has a light pine/forest undertone, but the overall impression isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd expect from a scent with this name.

It‚Äôs not unpleasant, just less woodsy than you might imagine. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty unisex, but not spicy.

The bottle is an elegant glass so it looks nice displayed and feels quality.",0,2025-04-15 12:43:35

customer_review-RUZ5V4V0QGWO5,B01CVXRCR2,Not my favorite,4.0,"April 24, 2023",Amazon Customer,0,"This scent smells exactly like described until it settles and dries and then the pine scent disappears. It‚Äôs pretty strong and did give me a headache, but only because I‚Äôm not too fond of this cologne scent once it‚Äôs settles. I feel this a more of a fall/winter scent and I don‚Äôt see myself wearing it at all as a spring/summer scent. The packaging was simple yet elegant",0,2025-04-15 12:43:38

customer_review-R1AFD2YTSW0HU3,B01CVXRCR2,Too earthy and woody for my liking,1.0,"April 24, 2023",Melissa,0,"- Upon spraying this perfume for the first time i was immediately repelled. It came off really strong and sharp. The eucalyptus note at the opening combined with pine note reminded me of an essential oil but not in a good way. I generally like bergamot note in perfumes but unfortunately i did not pick up this note in this perfume.
- The dry down is a tad too earthy and woody for my liking. Sadly i just don't like how the eucalyptus note lingers in the dry down and mixes with the base notes. It throws me off.
- The longevity is also not great. It lasts about 2 hours on me.
- Smell is subjective so even if this didn't work me it might work for you especially if you like the smell of eucalyptus and woody and earthy notes in general.",0,2025-04-15 12:43:38

customer_review-R2QYP64SZQQMXF,B01CVXRCR2,Its quite a floral blend. The pine is a bit more of a background. Very interesting mix,5.0,"April 30, 2023",Dave The Opinionater,0,"So I pretty much always give perfumes a 5 star since everyone has their own preferences. Its quite a mix of flowers minus the 'rose' that seems to be popular trend now. In my book this is a plus since I'm not a fan of 'rose' perfumes.
Its quite a balanced multi flower floral scent. Very natural smelling. The pine is an interesting background addition that if you pay attention you can notice it. Its like standing in a flower field next to a pine forest.

Very summer leaning for sure. Feminine mixed floral is how I would describe it. Worth a try if you are really into florals. Longevity seems to be about 5 hours on skin or a day+ on your clothing.",0,2025-04-15 12:43:38

I started with a spray on each forearm but I think that was a bit too much for me so I switched to one on my torso in the morning and I really like it.
