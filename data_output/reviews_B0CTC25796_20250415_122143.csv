customer_review-R2DIZ4O3A34BKY,B0CTC25796,"Brighten and Revive with Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum!""",5.0,"March 9, 2025",Ally smith,1,"I recently started using the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results! With a solid 4.3-star rating and over 8,500 reviews, this eye treatment serum has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine.

This serum combines retinal and niacinamide, two powerful ingredients that work wonders for puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines. After just a few weeks of use, I've noticed a significant reduction in the appearance of my under-eye bags and an overall brightening effect. My fine lines have also started to look less pronounced, which is a huge confidence booster!

The lightweight formula absorbs quickly into the skin, making it easy to layer under other products. I’ve been using it both in the morning and at night, and it plays nicely with my other skincare products, including moisturizers and sunscreens. Just be sure to apply it gently and allow it to absorb before layering on additional products.

The packaging is sleek and convenient, with a dropper that allows for precise application. A little goes a long way, so the 30ml size is quite generous and will last for a while.

Overall, I highly recommend the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum to anyone looking to combat puffiness and dark circles while improving the overall texture around the eyes. It’s effective, easy to use, and a fantastic addition to my skincare routine.",24,2025-04-15 12:21:17
customer_review-R3HO73O51UE39,B0CTC25796,Beauty of Joseon Eye Cream – A Miracle for Tired Eyes!,5.0,"February 16, 2025",Siarah,1,"If you’re looking for an eye cream that works instantly, the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum is a total game-changer! The moment you apply it, you can feel it hydrating and refreshing your under-eye area. And the best part? In just 10 minutes, your eye bags are visibly reduced, making you look well-rested and bright-eyed—even if you just woke up.

The formula is lightweight yet super nourishing, absorbing quickly without feeling greasy. It smooths, depuffs, and revitalizes tired eyes, making it perfect for anyone who struggles with dark circles or puffiness. If you need a quick fix for dull, tired eyes, this eye cream works absolute wonders!",29,2025-04-15 12:21:17
customer_review-R390NYNKID6EN9,B0CTC25796,"Great for Wrinkles, Color Correction Good but Tone-Specific",4.0,"February 15, 2025",Jae,1,"My last eye cream wasn't cutting it, so I decided to give this one a try. I'm really glad I did. Within the first week, I noticed a significant reduction in the fine wrinkles around my eyes - something my old Mizon eye cream never did. After that initial improvement, it didn't seem to do much more, but that was still a big win. The color correction aspect was a bit off for my skin tone, so I have to use it sparingly during the day, but it was surprisingly effective at reducing redness. Plus, it feels nice on the skin and doesn't have any strong scent.",21,2025-04-15 12:21:18
customer_review-RAHP8EJMNJEMD,B0CTC25796,"“Gentle, Hydrating, and Brightening: A Must-Have for Tired Eyes!”",5.0,"August 24, 2024",Tisha,1,"Texture and Application: The Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum has a lightweight, silky texture that absorbs quickly into the skin. It’s non-greasy and layers well under makeup, making it a great addition to both morning and nighttime skincare routines. The serum comes with a dropper applicator, which makes it easy to dispense just the right amount without any wastage.

Hydration and Comfort: One of the standout features of this eye serum is its hydrating power. It instantly soothes and moisturizes the delicate skin around the eyes, reducing the appearance of dryness and fine lines. The formula feels refreshing upon application and leaves the skin feeling soft and supple throughout the day.

Ingredients and Benefits: The serum is packed with nourishing ingredients like ginseng extract and retinal, which are known for their anti-aging and brightening properties. Over time, I’ve noticed a visible reduction in dark circles and puffiness, and the skin around my eyes looks brighter and more rejuvenated. The gentle formula is perfect for sensitive skin and doesn’t cause any irritation, which is a huge plus.

Packaging: The packaging is simple yet elegant, with a sturdy glass bottle that feels luxurious. The dropper applicator is hygienic and easy to use, ensuring you can control the amount of product you apply. The size of the bottle is also generous for an eye serum, making it a good value for the price.

Longevity: A little goes a long way with this serum. Just a small amount is enough to cover both eyes, meaning the bottle will last for several months even with daily use. The effects of the serum also seem to improve with consistent use, making it a worthwhile investment for long-term eye care.

Value for Money: Given the quality of the ingredients and the noticeable results, the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum offers excellent value for money. It’s priced reasonably for the benefits it delivers, making it accessible for those looking to add a high-quality eye serum to their skincare routine.

Conclusion: The Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum is a fantastic product that delivers on its promises of hydration, brightening, and anti-aging. Its gentle yet effective formula makes it suitable for all skin types, and the results speak for themselves. If you’re looking for an eye serum that can tackle dark circles, fine lines, and puffiness, this one is definitely worth trying. Highly recommended for anyone looking to revive and refresh their eye area!",98,2025-04-15 12:21:18

customer_review-R26S5V64WD558J,B0CTC25796,"Lightweight Hydration, But Limited Results for Stubborn Under-Eye Concerns",3.0,"October 29, 2024",Philly,1,"The Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum with retinal and niacinamide is a gentle, soothing eye serum that feels luxurious on the skin, but it may fall short in delivering noticeable results for those looking to reduce puffiness, fine lines, or dark circles. The lightweight formula absorbs quickly, leaving the under-eye area feeling hydrated and smooth, which is a nice start to any skincare routine.

While it’s comfortable to apply and offers hydration and mild soothing benefits, it doesn’t seem to provide the targeted effects one might hope for, especially for more stubborn issues like dark circles or deeper wrinkles. The retinal and niacinamide combination is promising, but the results may be subtle and require longer-term use to see any real improvements in tone or texture.

This serum is well-suited for those looking for a light, hydrating eye serum, but if you’re after significant correction for fine lines, puffiness, or dark circles, it might not be potent enough. Overall, it’s a pleasant addition to a routine for extra hydration, though the results may be too minimal for those expecting a more transformative effect.",179,2025-04-15 12:21:18

The lightweight formula absorbs quickly and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.

While results aren't dramatic overnight, consistent use has definitely improved the overall appearance of my eye area. This serum has become a staple in my skincare routine.",17,2025-04-15 12:21:18
customer_review-R2JKY2RQ0S4F1E,B0CTC25796,Finicky but miraculous,4.0,"January 29, 2025",Tanni Ahmed,1,"This stuff WORKS. However, it needs to be prepared and applied correctly or it’s useless. You HAVE to start with a completely clean, untouched base (if I use any kind of eye cream or moisturizer underneath it, it doesn’t do a darn thing.) But they do warn you about that in the instructions so it’s to be expected. I cleanse, then use a gentle toner (it MUST be oil-free) under the eyes and let it dry completely before applying.

You then have to apply JUST the right amount (trial and error, but I’ve found that about a pea size dot is enough for both eyes), and start by gently swiping on the area and THEN patting. When I start out by just patting, it doesn’t work as well. And do NOT get it right underneath the eyes.. it will be crepe-city. This is designed to reduce bags, not fine lines. When I get it too close under my eyes where I have lines I'm horrified. It also definitely feels weird and tight but that’s to be expected.

After applying, I’ve found that putting ANY kind of liquid/cream product on top of it (concealer, foundation, moisturizer) completely negates its effects. They say in the instructions that any kind of oil breaks down the tightening qualities and it’s true. So if you want to put makeup on top, it’s best to use some sort of lightweight powder. It does have a tint to it so I haven’t found the need for concealer when I’m wearing it.

It definitely is fussy and finicky BUT it works so well I don’t mind. If you read the instructions they are very straightforward about how particular you have to be to get good results, so it’s not like they’re trying to trick you. Now that I’ve practiced with it a bunch, I’ll never be without it. I won’t use it every day because I do like to put eye cream on in the morning and can’t do that with this, so I save it for special occasions or extra-puffy days. It’s expensive but worth it for those days.",52,2025-04-15 12:21:18

I don't think I have been using this long enough to speak to the effects of the retinal on fine lines, but what I do like is that it is a nice retinal eye cream that doesn't irritate my dry, sensitive eyes. I have to be very careful what I put near my eyes as many products cause eye irritation. Of course, I don't slather it all over my eyelids but I am able to use it under my eyes before bed and I haven't really had any issues with sensitivity. I will say that I also use tretinoin on my face at night (avoiding the eye area) and my skin does ok with retinoids so I would be careful if you are sensitive to retionoids as the eye area is quite delicate.",0,2025-04-15 12:21:18

After about a week of use I have had to stop because I’ve developed a retinol burn under one of my eyes. If you are not familiar with Retinol/Retinal products, it is recommended to start slow with only 2–3x per week use until your skin builds up a tolerance. I (ignorantly) assumed because I already regularly use Tretinoin that my skin would tolerate this well and not have an issue. Can’t speak to the long term efficacy of the product yet but I will try again with more caution once my eye heals. If you are considering this product, BE PATIENT! Start with only a few applications per week and preferably apply at night as your skin might also be more sensitive to UV damage when using. On nights when not using, be sure to moisturize and help support your skin barrier while you’re still adjusting.",18,2025-04-15 12:21:27

I used to use an eye cream that had a bit of shimmer that reflected the light to 'hide' my dark circles not help them. I don't feel this eye serum has helped too much with my dark circles but there is some change. The overall texture of around my eyes is much softer, the wrinkles that I have are less noticeable.

Secondly, because my previous eye cream was was a heavier consistency, I used too much with the first application. One pump for both eyes is enough for me. The eye serum is light weight with little to no fragrance. I dab between my 2 ring fingers and apply under my eyes and on my eye lids in a light swiping and tapping motion.

Lastly, there was no irritational from this eye serum. It has been gentle on my skin and very complimentary to another K-Beauty brands products that I use. I will continue using this product for the foreseeable future.",198,2025-04-15 12:21:29

I noticed my under eye area started getting dry crepe/wrinkly and hoped this would help! My under eyes are so incredibly smooth now - I use morning and night - I tap a bit of water first then the product. I let fully dry in the morning then use a sunscreen color corrector over top. I have used different concealers all with the same smooth result. I don't use powders under my eyes - don't need to. I don't go crazy with the amount but don't skimp either. I have had very sensitive eyes - with full blown eczema - so I'm careful. I've never had any negative reaction.,2,2025-04-15 12:21:33

customer_review-R3VUR108MSZRC4,B0CTC25796,"I’ve been let down by so many eye creams, but this one finally impressed me.",5.0,"October 10, 2024",Gina Arnone,1,"Finding an eye serum that delivers real results without costing a fortune has been a journey, but Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum has really impressed me. I was starting to think only high-end creams or simple options like CeraVe could do the job, but this serum handles everything I need—puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines—while remaining budget-friendly.

The serum has a lightweight consistency that absorbs quickly, and I really appreciate how it doesn’t leave a sticky residue. It feels refreshing around the eyes and layers beautifully under makeup without causing any pilling, which is a must for me. I love the combination of ginseng and retinal, which work together to hydrate and smooth the skin. Ginseng provides that deep hydration and elasticity boost, while retinal gently improves texture and firmness. It’s great that the retinal is in liposome form, so it’s more stable and less likely to cause irritation compared to traditional retinol.

What’s also great about this product is the size. A lot of eye creams come in tiny amounts that you burn through in no time, but this one gives you a more generous portion. I also like that it’s gentle enough for daily use and even works well for those with sensitive skin, like me. Over time, I’ve noticed a real improvement in how smooth and bright my under-eye area looks, which I haven’t found with many other products.

Final Thoughts
If you’re looking for an affordable yet effective eye serum, the Beauty of Joseon Revive Eye Serum is worth trying. It handles puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines without breaking the bank, and the combination of ginseng and retinal is great for long-term skin health. I’m really happy with the results so far, and it’s refreshing to find an eye product that actually works for me.",91,2025-04-15 12:21:35
customer_review-R3BUNAJFJ3WRCA,B0CTC25796,Broken pump..,4.0,"September 27, 2024",Sincerely Kristen,1,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to try ordering this anyway. I too, received this with a broken pump. They need to rethink the bottle/tube design. Totally bummed about that, but I don’t feel like waiting to have another sent or waiting on ordering the comparable item that was in the running. I’ve only been using it for a few days and have had no adverse reaction/sensitivity, so far. I did it one off and one on for the first 2 times and then switched to using it every night. It’s a little inconvenient to remove the cap and squeeze to dispense, as it is not designed to do that. This seems to be a good starter retinol, so I’ll try it and see how it does. I don’t find it to be greasy or to have any unpleasant or heavy fragrance. Now, time will tell..",2,2025-04-15 12:21:35

I’m always hesitant to use eye creams because I hadn’t found one that actually worked. Until I decided to take a gamble and try this one, which I saw talked about on TikTok…I am so happy with my purchase!
I am already very pleased with the results and I have not even been good at staying on a consistent schedule using it!
I use it at night before going to bed. I squeeze like a half pea size for each eye. A little goes along way because it is so smooth, easy to apply, and absorbs amazingly. Because it does have some retinal in it, and my under eyes can be sensitive to retinal mixing with other ingredients, I find the best time for me to apply is at night. I wake up to such moisturized and even looking skin under my eyes in the morning. Ugh, I’m in love. Like I said, it makes me like my face better haha I also like that it doesn’t have a scent - or at least not one that I can smell.
The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that my pump doesn’t work and hasn’t since I got it. I have to unscrew the cap to get the product out.",162,2025-04-15 12:21:35

One thing I haven’t seen mentioned in the review section so it might just be me but my eyelashes grew longer as well. I have very short eyelashes that i normally can’t curl them and have tried eyelash serum but it caused my eyelid to be darkened so i stopped using those. I wasn’t even purposely rubbing this on my eyelashes but it just came in contact with the cream i apply under my eyes and after 1 week i have long enuf eyelashes to curllll !!! Yayyyy !!!

A dermatologist recommended this eye cream for its moisturizing and non-pore–clogging abilities. She actually said while it was an eye cream, you could use on your whole face. I use one pump on my whole face morning and night

I don't know if it's the eye cream or the whole skincare revamp, but I've gotten a ridiculous amount of compliments on my skin. Two separate friends I hadn't seen in a couple of months asked me to send them instructions to my regimen! I chalk it up to three things: this eye cream for sure; Naked and Thriving's Renew night serum; and finishing my skincare routine with pure squalane oil to lock in the treatments.

This eye cream is a keeper for me. It's reasonably priced, feels really good on my skin, and it doesn't cause me any milia problems. I recommend it!",44,2025-04-15 12:21:40

This size will literally last months. I’ve only used this for 3 days but I’ve already noticed a difference. I don’t get paid for my reviews so this is an honest one haha.

My under eyes are ALWAYS dark like no matter how much sleep I get. These brightened me up better than anything I’ve ever used and it worked so fast too. I notified a difference the next day.

My under eyes feel super soft and hydrated and the best part is the cream is lightweight and rubs in nicely so it doesn’t feel like you have heavy goop under your eyes. Sometimes other under eye cream can feel heavy.

I have semi-sensitive skin too and this stuff was perfectly fine for me. By sensitive, I mean I usually get one or two random pimples if I try anything new and my skin doesn’t like it. My skin usually knows whether it likes something or not after the first day. I’m on day 3 and we’re going strong so I’m happy! Get this stuff!",60,2025-04-15 12:21:42
