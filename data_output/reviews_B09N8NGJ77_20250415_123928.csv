customer_review-R1C2G5US7H1J00,B09N8NGJ77,Cloud like lather!,5.0,"February 15, 2025",Amazon Customer,1,"This bar has the softest most cloud like lather I‚Äôve ever felt from a facial bar!

customer_review-R3C2FW9M2BMAAB,B09N8NGJ77,"Sooooo Good! Soothing, non drying and a joy to use.",5.0,"November 5, 2024",Amazon Customer,1,"Of all of the products l have tried by this company, this is hands down my favorite. I primarily use this as a facial cleanser, but you can use this on your body as well. I was a bit skeptical to use a bar cleanser, but that changed as soon as l used it. I have dry sensitive skin so wasn't expecting much, but l'm so happy l found this. It gives a lovely soft leather, feels great on
the skin, leaves your skin clean and soft, with no tightness. I'd much rather use this than the expensive Estee Lauder gel cleanser l was using before. Not only does this do a better job, but it is a fractions of the price.
My Husband even tried it and now using it as well. I will definitely keep purchasing this.",5,2025-04-15 12:38:37

I hope from this my Skin glows and hydrates.. As of now, packing is lovely and the Bar feels so smooth which I like. It‚Äôs unscented which is a plus it does not smell like strong fragrances because this imply this product is. Natural and not so harsh on Skin.. AS OF NOW I like it and will give out Update Size it‚Äôs pretty Small on my opinion but I‚Äôm planning to use it on my Skin only so I don‚Äôt mind.

Update:This has been the third day, I have been using the Rice Bar on my Skin. Day and Night.. let me tell you this makes your SKIN SO SOFT! And it gives you a natural Glow!!!! Not too Greasy glow just the one that makes you look like a natural soft Glow!! My Skin did not irritate at all no matter how many times of I applied this soap on my Face..

customer_review-R3P6HI735AT01I,B09N8NGJ77,Surprisingly Gentle,5.0,"December 23, 2023",Beth Ross,1,"I have sensitive, reactive, dehydrated and normal to dry skin. I easily break out when my skin is overstripped or the barrier is compromised in any way. For years I have been unable to use any cleanser that is foaming or sudsing in any way and have had to use only lotion type cleansers. I thought I would try this as I love other products from this line and the price was very reasonable. I am so surprised to say that I have been able to use this twice a day for so long that I went through an entire bar and bought two more! It foams nicely, and I have missed being able to use a foamy cleanser. The lather/foam it creates is thick and sift, and while it does leave my face a bit dry and tight, it has caused zero irritation or compromise to my skin barrier. I always follow with toners, essences, serums, and moisturizers regardless of my cleanser, so the initial tightness is not bothersome. While it does dry a bit, it doesn‚Äôt seem to actually dehydrate my skin. Best of all, it keeps my skin clear and bright better than almost any cleanser I have ever used. I am so shocked by this bar, not at all what I expect from this type of soap. So pleased!!",18,2025-04-15 12:38:38
