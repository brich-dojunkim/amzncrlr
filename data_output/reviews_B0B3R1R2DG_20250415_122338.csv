customer_review-RK65QP4FN17UV,B0B3R1R2DG,Really impressed,5.0,"November 22, 2022",Julie,1,"I have been using this serum for a month now and am really impressed. I decided to try this serum as I am post-menopausal and gingseng has estrogen-like compounds in it. I thought a ginseng serum might help with fine lines and texture. This serum is fragrance free. I thought it would smell like gingseng but no. The serum is the consistency of a thin gel. I press two drops into my skin. It absorbs quickly. As for results, I have been really impressed by how this serum evens out skin tone with use. Any pigmentation I had from sun exposure is really improved. In addition, the serum is very skin softening. I highly recommend this product for mature skin.",16,2025-04-15 12:23:32

I decided to try it again after it cleared up only every other day or maybe twice a week and haven‚Äôt had an issue again yet. Maybe it‚Äôs a good product and just not good for someone with combination skin. Helped with the dryness for sure though. I use prescription strength tretonin for acne and this helps with the dryness on the days I use that.,2,2025-04-15 12:23:38
