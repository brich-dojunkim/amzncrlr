customer_review-R94IW550940ZD,B09DLFCB69,Effective Serum for Brightening and Evening Skin Tone,5.0,"April 9, 2025",Christian Perez,1,"I've been using the serum for a few weeks now, and it's made a noticeable difference in my skin. The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly without any sticky residue. After consistent use, I've observed a reduction in dark spots and a more even complexion. The combination of rice bran water and alpha-arbutin seems to work well for brightening the skin. Additionally, it provides a good level of hydration, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple. I appreciate that it's fragrance-free and hasn't caused any irritation. Overall, it's a solid addition to my skincare routine, and I plan to continue using it.",0,2025-04-15 12:22:12
customer_review-R2EWR87J1N9LJD,B09DLFCB69,My skin adores BOJ,5.0,"September 3, 2024",Kathryn Magendie,1,"I had the trial size of this Glow Deep Serum. The mini size set contained this Glow Deep, another glow serum that has other types of antioxidants, snail mucin mixed with ginseng, and a green tea calming serum. Out of that set I reordered the two glow serums and likely will reorder the green tea. I use CoxRx snail mucin, which is amazing, so I likely won't order the ginseng and snail mucin though it is a great serum as well.

Beauty of Joseon is so calming and so gorgeous on my rosacea prone skin - I have Type 1, which means my cheeks and sometimes my nose will turn red or have some flushing. If my skin barrier is messed up, there could be stinging as well when I use some skincare products.

But BOJ calms my skin and this Glow Deep gives my skin a nice glow without being too shiny and is super great for hydration.

Alpha arbutin, an antioxidant that is basically Hydroquinone, comes from the bearberry plant, and works as a skin brightener and for post-inflammatory pigmentation, and helps with hydration.

It just makes my skin look and feel amazing. I am moving towards having most of my skincare come from BOJ, CosRx, and maybe some Gangnam Glow. These seem to be the ones that make my skin feel hydrated, calm my rosacea redness, give me a glow, help with mature skin, and are inexpensive. And CoxRx and BOJ are not fragranced, though a little essential oil fragrance doesn't seem to bother my skin too bad. But the perfumes will and these brands are not perfumed.",74,2025-04-15 12:22:12

customer_review-R1WRLDLMUPZA3F,B09DLFCB69,Love this product.,5.0,"November 4, 2024",Christina Pope,1,This stuff is amazing!!!!! The compliments i have received about my skin since I've started using this is crazy. I have been told my skin looks even and that it has a glow. I don't wear make up so it is a huge confidence boost. I had some hyperpigmentaion around my mouth and it is almost gone. I use it in the morning and at night. I don't miss a day. I feel consistency is key with this product. There is not really a scent and I like the texture because it is not watery but not thick either. I almost out so I will be buying another bottle. Also I had no irritation or break outs and my pores have got smaller and non-existent in some areas.,62,2025-04-15 12:22:12

I did like the hydration but I didn’t notice any real improvement in my dark spots or discoloration.

The texture is lightweight, absorbs well, and feels really soothing, especially on days when my skin feels a bit dry or irritated. I also appreciate that it’s fragrance-free, which is great for sensitive skin like mine.

That said, I was hoping to see more visible results with fading acne scars or evening out my skin tone. Unfortunately, I didn’t notice much difference in that area.

Overall, I’d give it 3 stars — great for hydration and a nice addition to your routine if you’re just looking for moisture and a calming serum, but it didn’t deliver on the brightening claims for me.",0,2025-04-15 12:22:16

customer_review-R161LBKEHFCJ0Y,B09DLFCB69,"""Not bad.. But not good."" - Jisoo",3.0,"October 14, 2024",Just here,1,"Initially bought for my mom because she wanted to attain glowy skin. However, there is MINIMAL stinging for those who have sensitive skin or broken skin. Thus she passed it on to me, now I will say it worked a little bit on my OVERLY QUENCHED dry skin. But the serum did put my rosacea and textured skin in the spotlight so keep that in mind for those of you with similar features.

The only issue is... it's not really a moisturizing agent nor do I feel like it's nurturing to the skin. It works like a clear shiny top coat over your face. It has the same consistency as any ampoule and I do like how it doesn't have that oily after effect. Yet sometimes I do feel like my pores are being blocked due to the ""full coverage"" properties. Leading me to use it as a last step of my skincare or for my really dry patches.

In conclusion, get this product if you only want to achieve ""surface"" level look for dewy skin. Such as photoshoots or natural makeup without any oily issues.

DON'T GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LONG TERM VITALIZING/NOURISHING BENEFITS! You're better off applying a ""moisturizing"" sheet mask from Korea.",12,2025-04-15 12:22:25

This serum is really good for my skin and gives me great moisturizer and no oiliness or residue. It also blends well with the other products I use on a daily basis (Tretinoin, Azelaic Acid, moisturizer, eye cremes).

A little also goes a long way with this product as you do not need a lot of it to spread on your entire face. It even pairs well with light sunscreens.

Over time I have seen improvement with dark spots on my face (but I would not attribute those improvements to this product alone as I mentioned above I do use other products).

I would definitely recommend trying this if you are searching for a gentle serum that gives you a bit of a glow without being glossy or shiny or irritating to your skin.",28,2025-04-15 12:22:25

First right of the bat it improved the texture of my skin leaving it very soft.
I had no irritations which is great.
I tend to get these “allergic reaction pimples” and spent a lot of money on truly beauty for example just to have itchy pimple all over my forehead and other areas. This was the reason why I looked into something else, and more affordable too.
This fit the bill and worth a try.
And I am so glad I did.
No itchy pimples and after a week I can’t totally tell that it’s working.
I can see that my skin is brighter.

It is not worth it for the price I bought at around 18? dollars or so. There are so many other better korean products for brightening skin at a better value. Also, the consistency is pretty thick and sticky which I didn't expect but will say wasn't too unpleasant. Also, it seems like it is pretty gentle/non irritating, but also be aware that if you do use the product, don't use it for too long because it is risky to use alpha arbutin for too long/more than 6 months",0,2025-04-15 12:22:37

I bought this with the hope of clearing my hyperpigmentation and it did not disappoint! I’ve only been using it for 5 days twice a day and I’m already seeing results. My family even noticed and complimented my complexion.

My favorite things about it is that it doesn’t have any scent, it’s very lightweight, and gentle on my sensitive skin. For reference, I have eczema and this gives my face that dewy look I never thought I could achieve. Best of all, it’s the only product I’m currently using on my face. I tend to have breakouts if I use multiple skincare products so it’s important to have one thing that targets multiple issues. I simply wash my face with warm water, pat dry, and apply this serum.
